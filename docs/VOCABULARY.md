# VOCABULARY

**Generated — run `npm run gen:docs`. Do not edit.**

Every closed vocabulary in the game, read off the schemas that define them.
Written so that authoring content or wiring an effect needs this file and
not `event.ts`, `conditions.ts`, `frequency.ts`, `person.ts` and `attributes.ts`.

`T?` optional · `T = x` defaults to x · `T[]` array · `A|B` one of

## Effects

What an outcome may do. The union is closed; `applyEffect` in
`core/src/events/effects.ts` ends in `assertNever`, so adding a kind is a
compile error until it is handled.

**Target** — who an effect lands on: `{ slot }`, `{ all }`, `head`, `household`, `all_blood`, `children_of_head`.

## Conditions

Gate an event, an Age onset or an arc successor on world state. Named by
which key is present. `all` / `any` / `not` nest.

## Filters

Narrow a slot's candidates, or an heirloom's eligible bearers. Run against
one person at a time.

| filter | shape |
|---|---|
| `attr` | `attr: string` `op: lt\|lte\|eq\|gte\|gt\|ne` `value: number` |

| `career` | `career: string[]` |
| `awakened` | `awakened: boolean` |
| `canExpress` | `canExpress: boolean` |
| `rung` | `rung: {atLeast}` |
| `relation` | `relation: not\|child_of\|sibling_of\|spouse_of\|blood_of` `of: string` |
| `all` | `all: Filter[]` |
| `any` | `any: Filter[]` |
| `not` | `not: Filter` |

## Who decides

`decidedBy` on a `choice` or `dispatch` interaction. Orthogonal to the
interaction kind: the shape says how many branches there are and whether the
player casts them, the decider says who takes one. Source:
`schema/src/decider.ts`, evaluated by `core/src/events/deciders.ts`.

| decider | shape | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| `player` | `decidedBy: player` | The docket stops the clock and asks. The default, and what a choice event has always been. |
| `chance` | `decidedBy: chance` | A weighted draw over the branches, each worth the sum of its outcomes' weights. |
| `state` | `decidedBy: { state: [{when: Condition?, take: string, because: string?}] }` | A ladder, read top down: the first rung whose `when` holds takes the branch it names. A final rung with no `when` is the else. The family's own condition decides. |
| `party` | `decidedBy: { party: { check: string } }` | The player casts the `castBy: player` slots — that is his decision — and the named Check, pooled over exactly those people, picks the branch. Its bands name CHOICE ids, not outcome ids. |

## Trees of events

An arc successor asks what happened in the parent. Every guard present must
hold, and exactly one successor is taken. Source: `schema/src/arc.ts`.

**Successor** — `to: string` · `when: Condition?` · `fromOutcome: string?` · `fromChoice: string?` · `fromTag: string?` · `weight: number = 100`

`Outcome.next` is the short form: `{event, after, keep}` on an outcome
compiles into a real arc before the engine sees it (`schema/src/desugar.ts`),
so a two-beat scene needs no arc file and there is still one thing that runs
a tree. `keep` names the slots cast with the same people in the follow-up.

## Frequency

A rationing tier, not a weight synonym. It reaches into scheduling,
presentation, folklore and whether a Record choice is required.

| tier | cap | cooldown | record block | folklore | chronicle |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `common` | none | none | forbidden | never | line |
| `uncommon` | none | 12 yr | optional | optional | paragraph |
| `rare` | 22/run | 30 yr | required | always | page, named |
| `mythic` | 3/run | 170 yr | required | always | illuminated, named |

## Enumerations

**SlotRole** — `head` · `family_member` · `spouse` · `child` · `sibling` · `cadet` · `unwoken` · `retainer` · `rival_house` · `outsider` · `heirloom` · `spellbook` · `tutor` · `rival` · `fragile` · `the_match` · `listener_record` · `listener_blood` · `guardian` · `foremost`
<br>Who a slot may cast. `core/src/events/slots.ts` narrows the pool.

**Purpose** — `advance_clause` · `change_relationship` · `worldbuild_through_action` · `establish_magic_rule` · `test_magic_rule` · `change_standing` · `plant_rumour` · `force_record_choice` · `buy_patience`
<br>Every template declares exactly three, all distinct.

**EventTier** — `individual` · `head` · `family` · `record` · `frame`
<br>`frame` events run in their own year phase, gated by `reads` rather than `conditions`.

**Frequency** — `common` · `uncommon` · `rare` · `mythic`
<br>A rationing tier, not a weight synonym. See the table below.

**ChronicleWeight** — `line` · `paragraph` · `page` · `illuminated`
<br>How an entry renders. Decided by frequency, not authored.

**RespectTier** — `unknown` · `known` · `regarded` · `eminent` · `exalted`
<br>Ordered. Decay floors at `known`; `unknown` has to be done to you.

**Register** — `warm` · `cold` · `institutional`
<br>An Age's texture. Two Ages of one register never run consecutively.

**CompareOp** — `lt` · `lte` · `eq` · `gte` · `gt` · `ne`

**Sex** — `male` · `female`

**PersonStatus** — `alive` · `dead` · `vessel_consumed` · `missing` · `given_to_church` · `ascended` · `guardian`
<br>`guardian` is the Narrator after he crosses over — never `alive` again.

**MembershipKind** — `blood` · `married_in` · `retainer` · `ward` · `hostage` · `clergy` · `cadet` · `none`
<br>One OPEN record per person. Two puts them in two halls at once.

**RetainerRole** — `tutor` · `steward` · `guard` · `midwife` · `archivist` · `singer` · `physician` · `chronicler`
<br>An `archivist` in post is what makes an Age pay its clause.

**AttributeKind** — `core` · `affinity` · `eldritch` · `derived` · `hidden`
<br>The list of attributes is open; nothing in the engine counts them.

## The year

In order. Each phase draws from its own RNG stream, seeded from its name.
Source: `core/src/year/phases.ts`.

| # | phase | after | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ages` | — | An Age is the weather every other phase happens in, so it is decided first. |
| 2 | `lifecycle` | `ages` | Awakening, Madness and mortality all read the year the Age has just set. |
| 3 | `guardian` | `lifecycle` | He can only have crossed over in the pass that tried to kill him. |
| 4 | `quarrels` | `lifecycle` | Grudges pass to the living and posts fall vacant, both on this year's deaths. |
| 5 | `secrets` | `quarrels` | A secret can only walk out with somebody, and `quarrels` is where service ends. Loyalty moves here too, so a year of arrears is priced before the next year's releases read it (`people/secrets.ts`). |
| 6 | `assize` | `ages` | The world reads the house as the Age has just left it, and before anything this year spends. |
| 7 | `bearing` | `assize` | Bearing is read off acts already taken and halls already angry, so it runs after the Assize has settled the year's standing and before the Match deals a hand against it. It draws no dice. |
| 8 | `careers` | `quarrels` | A career's income and Respect are owed to whoever is still living after this year's dead are settled, and `economy` needs the treasury they add before it tallies the year (issue #16). |
| 9 | `table` | `careers` | A term finishes for whoever is alive after `lifecycle`, and a reader is set to a book at the pace of whichever post `careers` has just given him. |
| 10 | `library` | `careers`, `table` | A book finished this year is finished by whoever is still alive after `lifecycle`, and by whichever career they held when `careers` settled — a Scholar who left the post mid-book still read it at a Scholar's pace, because the years were spent when the study began. |
| 11 | `economy` | `careers` | Wages are owed to whoever is still in post after the contracts settle, and the annual tally comes last so it sees career income too. |
| 12 | `auction` | `economy` | Bidding spends the treasury `economy` just tallied, and a lot bought this year should show up in the same year's chronicle as everything else that happened to the house (issue #17). |
| 13 | `succession` | `lifecycle` | The seat and the recurring cast refill on this year's vacancies. Without this the head, tutor and rival slots empty within a generation and the event pool silently collapses to nothing. |
| 14 | `branches` | `succession` | A son leaves the year his brother takes the seal, and not before. |
| 15 | `marriage` | `branches` | A bride joins the hall her husband is in, which the split has just decided. |
| 16 | `births` | `marriage` | A couple married this spring may conceive this year. |
| 17 | `arcs` | `births` | A substory casts from the living, and this year's dead and born are settled. |
| 18 | `ambient` | `arcs` | Substories get the year's attention before the ambient pool spends any of it. |
| 19 | `frame` | `ambient` | The frame reacts to the record — it has to run after the year has written its lines, not before. |
| 20 | `ascension` | `library`, `economy` | A rung is read off the books finished this year and the standing the economy has just set. |
| 21 | `generation` | `ambient`, `frame` | The generation counter gates content, so it turns over once everything else has. Tale circulation ticks here too — it only cares that the year has advanced, not what else fired in it. |

## Validation rules

Run one with `runRule(id, bundle)`. Source: `schema/src/rules.ts`.

| rule | what it is for |
|---|---|
| `ids/unique` | Two events with one id means one of them is unreachable, and save files name both. |
| `event/purposes` | CI gate 6. Exactly three distinct purposes, from the closed vocabulary (editor brief §4.5). |
| `frequency/obligations` | A tier is a set of duties, not a weight: Record blocks, folklore, caps, accounts. |
| `slots/references` | Every {TOKEN} names a declared slot, and a relation filter names one that is cast before it. |
| `slots/arc-bound` | A slot bound for a whole substory needs an arc, and an absent-body if it may go missing. |
| `madness/gate` | Madness may only be dealt to a target the slot has already gated to someone who can express. |
| `refs/known` | Ages, arcs, careers, spellbooks, knowledge flags, tales and their about-events named by content must be things that exist. |
| `tales/accounts` | CI gate 8. Every pair of an event's accounts must contradict on at least one field — differing bias is the minimum bar (issue #14). Two accounts that agree are one account written twice. |
| `discrepancy/wiring` | A Discrepancy proved or buried without ever being created cannot be found; provableBy must name a real house. |
| `secrets/wiring` | A secret on a contract becomes a Discrepancy under its own id, so nothing else may own that id. |
| `arcs/wiring` | An arc that points at a node or an event that is not there dies silently at that node. |
| `arcs/inline` | An inline follow-up must belong to exactly one chain, and must not compete with an authored arc. |
| `arcs/flags` | arc_flag effects and arcFlag/arcVisited conditions only mean anything inside a substory. |
| `decider/wiring` | A state ladder must name real branches and end in an unguarded rung; a party decider needs a check and a party. |
| `outcomes/weights` | A group of outcomes whose weights sum to zero can never resolve. |
| `event/shape` | A choice with one option is narration; a body of twenty words is a stub. |
| `checks/wiring` | A Check must be declared to be named, its bands ordered highest-first, and every band must name a real outcome — or, for a check a party decider spends, a real branch. |
| `ages/coverage` | An Age with no content of its own is a modifier wearing a name. |
| `clause/ages` | CI gate 7. A clause pinned to fewer than two Ages is a clause some runs never see. |
| `prologue/shape` | One prologue, three beats, and both of its choices pointing at things that exist. |
| `ending/complete` | All five endings, once each. An ending nobody wrote is an ending that cannot fire. |
| `ending/ring` | Every ending replays the prologue with EXACTLY ONE element changed. Two is a rewrite, none is not a ring. |
| `traits/mystic-restriction` | Women practise only the Threshold four (concept §9), so a female-tagged elemental trait is unlearnable. |
| `houses/alleles` | A house's gene pool must name loci and alleles that exist, or it is a characterisation the genome never receives. |
| `event/purpose-overlap` | CI gate 6. A triple used far past its share is one event written several times. |
| `prose/voice` | Bodies over five sentences are held to the countable half of the prose manual. The frame answers to a tighter budget (issue #13). |
| `prose/bearing` | No choice label names bearing — it must never read as a stat (concept §29, rule 1). |
| `frame/shape` | The frame reacts to the record: no effects, no Record block, no rumour, no choices, no slot against the living family, and at least one read to react to. `reads` is frame-only, and a `chronicled` read names an event that can actually leave a page. |
| `events/player-share` | At least a quarter of the library must actually ask the player something. |
| `rites/wiring` | A rite names declared slots, casts its ascendant from a pool that can express, and takes its subject. |
