# COMMANDS

The command block itself lives in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#commands) and is the
only copy — a number kept in two files is wrong in one of them within a few
commits, and `npm run test:fast` was once documented at four different figures
at once while actually taking a hundred seconds. `packages/core/src/codemap.test.ts`
fails the build if a second copy grows back, so **quote no timing here**.

This file is the part that is prose rather than a line: how a session starts,
what the landing actually does, what CI is shaped like, and which of those
commands answer a question nothing else can.

---

## How a session starts

A fresh session on the web orients itself, installs dependencies and warms the
content cache before an agent reads anything — `.claude/hooks/session-start.mjs`,
registered as a SessionStart hook. Locally it does nothing; you already have
`node_modules` and a whole history.

**Orienting is `tools/orient.mjs`, and it is not cosmetic.** The clone arrives
SHALLOW — a third of the history — and a shallow clone does not refuse ancestry
questions, it answers them wrongly: `git branch --merged`, `git log main..x` and
every "has this landed?" come back false past the graft boundary. A cleanup
script trusted that answer once and reported 29 branches as unmerged that were
all merged. The hook unshallows so the answers are real, then prints which
issues other sessions are holding. What that cost before it existed is in
[PARALLEL.md](PARALLEL.md).

## The landing

`npm run land` is the whole landing, and [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#working-style)
records standing authorization to run it and push with no PR and no prompt.

It fetches, rebases onto `origin/main`, installs, and runs **the whole set CI
runs on that rebased head** — typecheck, validate, test and `npm run gate` —
then pushes and waits for CI. `npm run check` is NOT that set: it omits the
gates, which are a third of what CI does, and landing on it broke `main` four
times. `packages/core/src/tools/land.test.ts` derives the step set from
`.github/workflows/check.yml`, so a new CI job the landing does not run fails
the build.

The wait matters because a push is not finished until a verdict comes back, and
there are **four** answers: green, red, **pending** (CI started and has not
finished) and **absent** (a run that concluded in seconds with no steps, out of
Actions minutes). An absence looks exactly like a pass in every UI. A red build
is yours to fix; an absent one is not, and is still not a pass — say so, and
name the commit. `npm run verdict` asks on its own; `npm run land -- --no-verdict`
skips the wait.

**It refuses to start unless a commit says `Closes #<issue>`** when the branch
is claimed for one, because `(#61)` in a title is decoration and GitHub reads
only the keyword — a landing without it goes green and leaves the issue open
with nothing saying so. That guard is right for the normal case and wrong for
one real case: work that advances an issue without satisfying its acceptance.
`npm run land -- --no-issue-check` is the documented way past it, and reaching
for it should mean *this genuinely does not close the issue*, not *I forgot the
keyword*. Issue #61 is the worked example — Stage E5 built the missing casting
primitive and measured that Apotheosis is still unreachable, so it landed
without the keyword and the issue stayed open.

### Connector-only sessions use `/land` as the remote shell

A session that has the GitHub connector but cannot execute repository commands
does **not** downgrade the rule to "the pull request is green". A PR can have a
green `check` against yesterday's `main` and be stale by the time it is
merged; that is exactly the gap the rebase inside `land` exists to close.

For that environment, open a **ready, same-repository PR targeting `main`**
and add a top-level comment whose whole body is:

```
/land
```

`.github/workflows/remote-land.yml` accepts that request only from a repository
collaborator with write-or-better permission. It checks out the exact PR head
named by the request, restores the feature-branch name for claim checks, and
runs **`npm run land` itself** on a GitHub-hosted runner. The command still
fetches and rebases onto current `main`, derives the check set from
`check.yml`, pushes by SHA so a concurrent landing is rejected, and waits for
the normal post-push verdict. The workflow serializes remote landings, but it
does not need to serialize against local ones because the final Git push is the
same compare-and-swap in both paths.

A failed remote workflow is deliberately ambiguous about whether a push
happened: `land` can fail before the push, lose the push race, or push and then
receive a red/absent verdict. Its final PR comment therefore names current
`main` and points back to the landing log instead of saying "nothing landed".
Do not click GitHub's merge button as a substitute.

### A change made only of markdown gets the short set

When every file the branch changes is `.md` **and** the commit it lands on has a
green verdict, the landing runs `typecheck`, `validate` and `test:fast` instead
of the whole set — exactly CI's short tier — and CI does the same for that push.
`npm run land -- --full` runs everything anyway.

This is safe for a reason that can be checked, not assumed: the gates and the
slow suites load only the simulation sources and the content YAML, and the
content loader refuses anything that is not YAML. What reads markdown is the
fast lane, and it reads it as data — `codemap.test.ts` for dead paths and the
size of `AGENTS.md`, `codex.test.ts` for the Codex byte budget, `docs.test.ts`
for a hand-edited `docs/VOCABULARY.md`. So a markdown-only change still runs
the tests that can fail on it, and skips only the ones that cannot see it.

It is not the rule this file once described and `tools/land.mjs` retired — an
agent classifying its own diff from memory. `tools/docs-only.mjs` is one
function over `git diff --no-renames`, shared by the landing and `check.yml`,
and it fails safe: a renamed `.ts`, an empty diff, a diff it cannot compute or
a base that is red, pending or unjudged all get the full set. The green-base
rule is the one that matters most — a short run on top of a red `main` would
record a green verdict and tell every reader the red had gone away.
`land.test.ts` fails the build if code outside the fast lane starts naming a
markdown file, which is the day the argument above stops being true.

### A landing has to outlive the session that started it

An hour of work, in a container that is paused between turns. **Start it in a
background the harness tracks** — in Claude Code, the Bash tool's
`run_in_background` — and **never with `nohup … &`**, which the shell knows
about and nothing else does. Twice on 2026-09-08 a `nohup` landing was killed
by that pause and left no exit code, no error and a log that simply stopped
mid-suite on a green tick; the same command under a tracked run reached
`landed, and judged.`

**`npm run land -- --status` is the reading**, and it exists because working
it out took four probes — `ps aux`, a log tail, `cat .git/land.lock`, `git
worktree list` — none of which an agent thinks to run until it already
suspects something. It answers one of three things:

| Reading | What it means |
|---|---|
| `no landing is running` | nothing to recover; start one |
| `a landing is RUNNING … at <step>` | leave it alone, it is between steps |
| `a landing DIED … at <step>` | recover — and the step says how |

The step is the whole point of the lock carrying more than a pid. A landing
killed at `test` **pushed nothing**. One killed at `verdict` **put a commit on
`main` and did not stay to hear the answer** — the absent verdict above,
arriving by a different road, and the one case where re-landing is the wrong
move: run `npm run verdict` against that commit instead. Killed at `push`
itself is genuinely ambiguous, and is reported as ambiguous rather than
guessed: check `git log --oneline -1 origin/main`.

The next `npm run land` clears a dead lock by itself, prints the same reading
on the way past, and sweeps the worktree the killed landing left registered —
`process.on('exit')` does not run for a process that was killed, so those
accumulate in `/tmp` otherwise.

## CI, and the janitor

`.github/workflows/check.yml` runs **in two tiers**. The short one — `lint`
(typecheck + validate + prose annotations) and `fast lane` — runs on every
event, always. The full one adds `test` as a four-way vitest shard, `gates` in
two lanes (`batch` and `war`), a `windows` runner and a `corpus` warm that
nothing waits on, and it runs on every push to `main`, every tag, every manual
dispatch and every pull request that is **not a draft**. A draft pull request
gets the short tier, and the `full-ci` label raises it without undrafting.
A push or pull request made only of markdown, on a base whose own verdict is
green, gets the short tier too — see [the landing](#a-change-made-only-of-markdown-gets-the-short-set)
for why that skips nothing that could fail. A tag or a manual dispatch always
runs everything.
Serial, the build reported only the FIRST thing wrong, so a moved gate hid
behind a failing test and cost another whole run to find; each job now answers
independently, and every matrix sets `fail-fast: false` so a shard cannot
cancel its siblings and rebuild that failure mode one level down.

**Why the tier exists**, measured over runs 169-198: `codex/issue-61-channel`
started three full builds in **ten seconds** and two were cancelled on arrival;
`codex/issue-133-stage5` started eight in seventeen minutes and seven were
cancelled. The cancellation is correct — superseding a stale run is what
`cancel-in-progress` is for — and the waste is upstream of it, in firing the
expensive half at a commit that will be superseded before it finishes. The
default is still the safe one: an ordinary pull request is not a draft, so it
gets exactly the coverage it always did, and cheap iteration is something you
opt into rather than something you can forget your way out of.

**The build was 68 minutes and one shard was all of it.** Run 185 (`main`,
green): every job started within three seconds of every other, seven of the
nine finished inside 21 minutes, and `test 2/4` took **67m47s** while the other
three shards took 3m02s, 10m45s and 4m03s. Vitest shards by a hash of the file
PATH, not by duration, so which suites a shard draws is re-rolled whenever a
test file is added anywhere — and every shard was green throughout.

Two things fixed it. The shards are packed by recorded duration now
(`tools/shards.mjs`, off `tools/test-durations.json`), so four shards cannot
fall apart by coincidence of filename. And **one file was most of the problem
underneath that**: `burying.slow.test.ts` polled `g.view()` — which rebuilds
the household tree, the halls and a chronicle slice — two and three times a
turn to read a number, over about fourteen thousand turns a run, sixty-five
seeds and two policies. It plays exactly what it played before. Measured on a
four-core container, before and after:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `npm test` | ~65 min | **~14 min** |
| packed shards | 60.2m / 14.6m / 14.6m / 14.6m | **~10m each** |
| spread | 4.12x | **1.00x** |
| longest single file | 60.2m, over a 26.0m fair share | **~9m, under ~10m** |

Those are container figures. **On the runners**, run 197 (`main`, green,
`a1c3c3c`): `gates (batch)` 22m54s, `gates (war)` 10m10s, the four shards
10m05s / 5m31s / 5m30s / 5m27s, `windows` 2m51s, `fast lane` 1m27s, lint 30s,
corpus 22s, tier 3s — **23m03s of wall clock, against the 68m #142 opened
with**, with no test deleted and nothing moved off `main`.

The conclusion that follows is now the opposite of the one that stood here for
a month: `gates (batch)` is the floor, and the longest test shard finishes in
under half of it, so balancing the shards further buys nothing. That is what
the old block claimed — at a moment when it was worth forty-six minutes a
build. It is true now for the same reason it was false then, and it stops
being true the moment either figure moves. A faster build means the `batch`
gate lane.

The shards are not level on the runners (10m05s against 5m27s) while the
committed table packs them level, and that is not the packing failing: the
durations come from a four-core container with a warm corpus, and a runner is
a different machine that may restore a cold one. What the table gets right is
the *relative* cost of the files. `lanes.test.ts` asserts the packing against
those recorded durations — a structural claim about one file being too big —
never against a runner's clock, which would be a stopwatch in CI and muted
within a fortnight.

**What went stale, and what was done about it.** `check.yml` had claimed
`18m02s of wall clock` since run 125 and carried a written argument that
balancing the shards would buy nothing — sound when written, and then `war`
halved (the 500-year term, #133) while `test 2/4` quadrupled, so the floor
stopped being the gates and the argument survived the fact it rested on.
`vitest.config.ts` and this file carried their own copies. All three said, in
their own prose, that a timing comment is perishable. **The warning is not the
mechanism**, so the numbers that decide anything are data now: `npm run cost --
--full --write` measures them, the sequencer packs from them, and a test fails
when they drift. What is left in the comments is the reasoning, which is the
part a number cannot carry.

**The gates job was the longest thing in CI, not the tests**, before any of
this. Measured off run 123's own timestamps: `test 34m04s`, `gates 36m24s` —
against comments that had claimed 13m and 8m since run 98. Two gates were
ninety per cent of the gates job (`war` 16m38s, `fire-rate` 16m05s), and
`outcome-reach` and `vocabulary-reach` cost three and four milliseconds because
they read `fire-rate`'s batch. So the lanes are `war` alone against everything
else: splitting anywhere else would play a 250-run batch twice.

**The landing is a separate problem, and it got its own fix.** Sharding buys
the verdict; it cannot help `npm run land`, which runs on one container. So
the landing overlaps instead: `typecheck` and `validate` still go first and
alone — twenty-three seconds that catch a broken template before anything
spends forty minutes — and then `test` and `gates` run AT THE SAME TIME.
Vitest takes a worker per core; `npm run gates` is a single node process
walking the gate table in a serial loop, so it held one core for thirty-six
minutes while three sat idle. About 196 core-minutes of work that took 76
minutes of clock **measured 40m01s** overlapped, on 2026-09-13 — fetch to
push, with the CI verdict wait on top of that.

It reports BOTH, too. A serial landing died at the first failure, so a red
test hid a moved gate and cost another 76 minutes to find it — the argument
this file already made about CI's jobs, which had been true of the landing the
whole time.

Everything runs on every push to `main` that touches anything but markdown,
because this repository fast-forwards without pull requests and a PR-gated job
would run approximately never. The gate
step runs everything in `GATES` rather than a list of names, because the list
used to be kept by remembering and gate 2 was left off it.

**One job runs on Windows, and it is the one that makes AGENTS.md's
"Supported environments" a fact rather than a sentence.** It runs the same
`typecheck`, `validate` and `test:fast` an agent runs — no Windows-only
variant, because a variant is a command that drifts. The fast lane is the whole
answer because that is where the suites that spawn the real scripts live:
`settings`, `orient`, `janitor`, `land`, `agents`, `verdict` and
`portability` all run the tooling and read what it prints. The gates and the
slow lane stay on one platform; a seeded pure simulation returns the same
numbers on either, and a second runner spending thirty minutes to re-derive
them would buy nothing. It costs no wall clock either way — the build's floor
is the `war` gate lane at 16m50s, and everything in the Windows job runs
several times inside that.

`npm run land` cannot stand in for it. The landing runs on whatever machine
the agent is on, so green there says the suite passes THERE. `ciScripts` in
`tools/land.mjs` knows `test:fast` is covered by the `test` it already runs —
a declared subset, not a suppression — and nothing it could run would cover
the platform.

`janitor.yml` runs `tools/janitor.mjs` on every push to `main`: it deletes
branches already merged there, retires every claim ref those branches were
holding, and closes what a landing commit named. **An agent's own git proxy
refuses ref deletion**, so that housekeeping cannot happen anywhere else — do
not try it, and do not read a surviving branch as work in flight.
`DRY_RUN=1 node tools/janitor.mjs` shows what it would do.

## The ones that answer a question nothing else can

- **`npm run digest` proves a refactor changed nothing.** Run it before and
  after. If the fingerprint block moves it was not a refactor — and since each
  year phase draws from its own RNG stream, a moved block points at the system
  that moved it.
- **`npm run harness`** is the only viable balance method. One playthrough is
  8–12 hours; never claim a balance change works without a batch behind it.
- **`npm run mutate`** breaks code on purpose and lists what no test noticed. A
  PROBE, run deliberately — never a CI threshold.
- **`npm run gate:drag` / `:blood` / `:ladder` / `:bearing`** are the four
  measured sessions; their arguments and findings are in
  [BALANCE-LOG.md](BALANCE-LOG.md).
- **`npm run gate:density`** (issue #88) reports what the player is asked and
  how often the same thing twice — per generation, per Age, the repeat rate
  within a run and within an Age, and the longest span carrying no Match, no
  Record block and no Age boundary. It takes `--seeds=` so the band in
  `attention.slow.test.ts` can be re-derived from that file's own pool; a band
  measured on other seeds is one nobody can reproduce when it goes red. Like
  the four above, it prints and does not judge.
- **`npm run cost`** re-measures the figures in AGENTS.md's block; `--write`
  applies them. They are measured on a four-core container and are perishable.
- **`npm run scoreboard`** gives the red rate on `main` and which job went red.
- **`npm run agents`** is the claim protocol — see [PARALLEL.md](PARALLEL.md).
  `check` before the long run says whether somebody landed in your paths while
  you worked.

`packages/content/loci.yaml` and `docs/VOCABULARY.md` are **generated**
(`npm run gen:loci`, `npm run gen:docs`). Never hand-edit either;
`.claude/hooks/guard-edit.mjs` denies the attempt.
