/**
 * TWO SPEEDS, AND THE FILENAME SAYS WHICH.
 *
 * `*.slow.test.ts` is a suite that plays whole games — the ones that assert
 * the SHAPE OF A HEALTHY RUN, which is the only way to catch a house that
 * quietly empties or a scene that never fires. Forty-three of them cost about
 * forty minutes of CPU between them, and there is no cheaper way to get what
 * they check.
 *
 * Everything else asserts a mechanism against a world built by
 * `core/src/testing.ts` and finishes in seconds. That is the loop you want
 * while fixing a bug: `npm run test:fast`. What it costs is stated once, in
 * AGENTS.md's command block, and measured by `npm run cost` — see below. Run
 * the whole suite before you claim anything works; `npm run check` does.
 *
 * ── AND THE NUMBERS ARE NOT IN THIS COMMENT ANY MORE ──────────────────────
 *
 * They were, and they rotted. Twice. "45 files in about 26 seconds" for a lane
 * that had reached 84; a floor named after two files that had not been the
 * floor for months; and then, after a re-measurement that fixed both, a
 * per-file floor of 451s quoted in a build where one shard had reached 67m47s.
 * Each version of this comment told the next reader to treat it as perishable,
 * and each one was believed anyway — because a comment cannot notice that it
 * has stopped being true, and nothing else was looking.
 *
 * So what a file costs is DATA now: `tools/test-durations.json`, written by
 * `npm run cost -- --full --write`. `tools/shards.mjs` packs CI's shards from
 * it and `lanes.test.ts` fails the build when the packing goes lopsided, so a
 * figure that goes stale makes a test fail instead of making an argument
 * wrong. See `sequence.sequencer` below, and issues #143 and #146.
 *
 * What stays in prose here is the part a number cannot carry: which lane a
 * suite belongs in, and why.
 *
 * A new suite that plays a whole game takes the `.slow` suffix. One that does
 * not, does not. `lanes.test.ts` enforces that now, because for months it was
 * only ever asked for: seven suites sat in the fast lane playing millennia and
 * took it to a hundred seconds, and every one of them passed the whole time.
 *
 * IT ENFORCES A SECOND RULE NOW, because the first one is not enough. A suite
 * can drive a batch through somebody ELSE's loop and the text-level net sees
 * nothing: `gates.test.ts` contains no `newGame`, no `advance` and no
 * `runYears`, and cost 61 seconds — 41% of the whole fast lane — because the
 * runs happen inside the gate functions it calls. Driving a batch through a
 * `tools/` module is now something a fast-lane suite has to DECLARE, with what
 * it drives; see `DRIVES_A_BATCH` in `lanes.test.ts`.
 *
 * TWO THINGS ABOUT THE SLOW LANE ARE WORTH KNOWING BEFORE ADDING TO IT.
 * VITEST PARALLELISES PER FILE, so the longest single file is a floor that
 * nothing else can get under — not the other workers, not a shard count, not
 * the sequencer below. `record` held that position at 451s (240 runs of 458
 * years for two assertions) until it was rewritten to read its runs back;
 * `ledger` and `branches` held it before that. All three were fixed the same
 * way and it is the only way: SPLIT THE FILE BY TEST. Never by seed range —
 * these are batch statistics, and taking seeds out of a batch changes what the
 * batch claims. Which file holds the floor today is in the durations table,
 * and `npm run cost` prints it along with what each shard would cost.
 *
 * And the per-file fixed cost is the Zod pass over the content bundle, about
 * 200ms, since `@ed/content` caches the YAML parse — across the fast lane that
 * fixed cost is the majority of the lane's wall clock, not the tests. It is
 * also why an unmeasured file is packed with a floor rather than as free; see
 * `UNMEASURED_MS`.

     * ISOLATION OFF, AND INVARIANT 8 IS WHY IT IS SAFE.
     *
     * Vitest gives each test FILE a fresh module registry by default, so the
     * whole `@ed/core` graph is rebuilt per file. 85 of the test files import
     * the barrel, and the cost showed up as `collect`: 64.5s of an 82.8s fast
     * lane was module construction rather than assertions.
     *
     * The reason that default exists is module-level mutable state — one file
     * mutating a counter another file reads. This repository already forbids
     * exactly that, in invariant 8: "Id sequences live on WorldState.counters,
     * never at module scope — a module-level counter is shared by every
     * simulation in the process." A grep over `packages/core/src` finds none.
     *
     * So the precondition holds by RULE rather than by luck, and the rule is
     * older than this setting. The repository had already paid for the
     * optimisation; it was not collecting it.
     *
     * MEASURED, on a four-core container, `npm run test:fast`:
     *   isolate: true    82.77s   (collect 64.50s)
     *   isolate: false   see AGENTS.md's command block
     *
     * If a suite ever needs a fresh registry, it says so per-file with
     * `// @vitest-environment` or its own describe-level setup, rather than by
     * turning this back on for all 132.
