   * three books read, so the two halves of the same gate were never available
   * in the same century — at 1142 the house had a man past Adept's power gate
   * and nothing for him to read, and by the time the shelf filled there was
   * nobody left who could express anything.
   *
   * A house that signed what this one signed owns books. Seeding them is not a
   * gift of power: the ladder still wants the blood, the Madness and the
   * standing, and a book on the shelf is only a book somebody has to be put in
   * front of (§13's table).
