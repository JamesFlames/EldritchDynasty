 * `state` ladder, a `chance` draw, a narration — resolves itself and goes
 * into the chronicle as something that happened while the player was looking
 * elsewhere.
 *
 * Both are wanted, and the second is cheaper to write, which is the problem
 * this rule exists for. Texture is easy: a hundred templates of weather and
 * pantry can be added in an afternoon and every one of them is a line in the
 * chronicle and none of them is a game. Nothing anywhere reports the drift,
 * because a run full of narration looks exactly like a run full of decisions
 * from the outside — same fire rates, same gates, same green CI.
 *
 * FOUR SHAPES COUNT AS ASKING, and they are counted because each one puts a
 * question in front of the player rather than in front of the simulation:
 *
 *   `decidedBy: player` on a choice or dispatch — the docket, the default,
 *                       and what a choice event has always been.
 *   `decidedBy: { party }` — the player casts the `castBy: player` slots and

 *                       WHO GOES is the decision (`decider.ts`).

 *   a Record block — Record / Omit / Embellish, which dockets its own
 *                       decision and is the mechanical form of the thesis.
 *
 * 25% is a FLOOR AND NOT A TARGET, set the way gate 4's 0.5% fire-rate floor
 * was: far enough below where the content stands that it never argues with an

/**
 * §29's FIRST RULE, made into a check — and NARROWER than the issue's literal

 *
 * Rule 1 says no player-facing string may contain *pride*, *arrogance*,
 * *hubris* or *vanity*. Rule 4, four lines later, says **only other people say
 * it** — *"one circulating tale calls the house proud, another calls it
 * dignified, and both stand."* Those two rules cannot both be read literally,
 * and when this was first built as a flat word match over everything a player
 * can read, it returned five hits of which four were the design working:
 *
 *   - two nested tales, which is rule 4's own named channel
 *   - `the village decides the house is either very poor or very proud and
 *     settles, after some discussion, on proud` — other people, verbatim
 *   - a grandmother `not proud of` a household count, which is the word
 *     meaning something else entirely
 *
 * A rule that fires on four good sentences to catch one is a rule that
 * teaches authors to write worse, and this file's own convention is that a
 * floor belongs where it does not argue with the content that exists.
 *
 * So it checks the thing rule 1 is actually protecting: **it must never
 * become a stat.** *No stat, no meter, no bar* is the first half of that
 * sentence and is the half with teeth. In the content directory the nearest
 * thing to a meter is a CHOICE LABEL — the words on the button, which is
 * where a player looks to find out what a decision is called. There is no
 * legitimate scene in which the button names this. Prose may say what the
 * village thinks; the button may not tell the player what he is spending.
 *
 * The other half of rule 1 lives outside content, in the client, and is
 * asserted where it belongs: `session-api.test.ts` holds the read model to
 * exposing no bearing at all.

 * thing a house has several of — beside a mill, a woodland, a common and a
 * home demesne, each named with the definite article: "the mill," not "a

 * naming a slot, an arc binding — takes the FIRST cast, which is an arbitrary
 * man out of up to five. That reads as working: the effect lands, the check
 * scores, the chronicle names somebody. It is simply four men short, and
 * nothing anywhere reports it. `{ all: }` and `party_sum` are the plural
 * forms, and this rule is what makes an author reach for them.
