/**
 * RIVAL-HOUSE DESCENT (issue #24 item 6).
 *
 * The design accepted for rival genetics is that every person's genome is
 * already materialized from their OWN house's real `genePool`
 * (`people/factory.ts`), so a rival's daughter draws faithfully from her
 * house's font and deleterious frequencies rather than a generic pool. What
 * was missing is DESCENT: each new rival character was an independent draw
 * from a static frequency table, not a child of a previously-materialized
 * rival ancestor through real meiosis.
 *
 * This is that lineage, and it is deliberately shallow. A `RivalPerson` is a
 * genealogical fact and nothing else — no membership, no career, no cast
 * slots, no chronicle, no docket. Its only reader is `people/rivals.ts`
 * (which grows it) and `people/minting.ts` (which, when the Match deals a
 * card for this house, mints a real `Person` from one of these rather than
 * rolling a fresh genome). See `RIVAL_LINEAGE_HOUSES` in `people/rivals.ts`
 * for which houses grow one, and AGENTS.md issue #24 for the staged build
 * order this belongs to.
