/**
 * The bundle used to be loaded twice by two different implementations —
 * `@ed/content` off the filesystem for tests and the harness, the editor over
 * `import.meta.glob` in the browser — and each carried its own copy of the
 * table saying which collection lived in which file.
 *
 * When they drifted the symptom was not an error. The editor simply simulated a
 * different game: the browser loader never collected `characterTemplates`, so
 * no spouses were minted, every line died out by 1150, and the tree view
 * disagreed with the harness for a whole session before anyone noticed.
 *
 * There is one table now — `CONTENT_LAYOUT` — and both loaders do nothing but
 * hand over files as text. These tests guard the table itself.
