/**
 * NESTED TALES (issue #14, ~5% of the text).
 *
 * The rule that governs this whole file: **no nested tale is neutral.** A
 * tale is always performed by someone with a motive, and the game never
 * adjudicates between two contradicting accounts in its own voice — there is
 * no narrator who knows the truth, only Daveed, and he is not neutral either
 * (AGENTS.md, "Do not"). `teller` and `bias` are therefore required, not
 * optional colour.
 *
 * An event of consequence names two or more tales in its `accounts`, and
 * `tales/accounts` (CI gate 8, `rules.ts`) fails the build if a pair of them
 * do not contradict on at least one field. Differing `bias` is the minimum
 * bar; the record layer's claim vocabulary (issue #19) raises it to
 * field-level contradiction once it exists.
