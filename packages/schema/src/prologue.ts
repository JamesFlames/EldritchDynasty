/**
 * THE PROLOGUE — A DEBT OF THREE PARTS (concept §3, issue #38).
 *
 * Twelve to eighteen frame interludes a run refer back to a signing the player
 * never saw. The frame is the promise every generation is played against, and
 * until this file it was a promise about an event that happened off-screen to
 * nobody.
 *
 * It is authored rather than written in the client for the reason everything
 * else here is: the epilogue has to be able to replay it. §23's ring is the
 * prologue's own triad restated with EXACTLY ONE element changed, which is
 * only possible if the triad is data both ends can read.
 *
 * ─── Register ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Dunsanian — `.claude/skills/lovecraftian-prose`, never `rothfuss-prose`.
 * This is the single most likely place in the game for register bleed, because
 * it is the one screen where the mythic layer and the tutorial impulse meet.
 * `prose.ts` holds the frame register to its contract.
 *
 * ─── What is withheld ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The founder is never named. He is "the man", "your ancestor". Names are
 * load-bearing in this world and his is withheld deliberately — the player
 * names the HOUSE, which is the thing that persists, and that is the whole
 * design of the game stated once before a year has passed.
