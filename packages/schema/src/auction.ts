/**
 * THE AUCTION (issue #17) — how a Discrepancy gets proven by purchase.
 *
 * Rare, announced years ahead so the player can liquidate, borrow, or start
 * planning something regrettable. Lots are GENERATED AT RUNTIME rather than
 * authored — there is no `AuctionLotDef` in content, on the same bargain
 * `ArcInstance` makes with `ArcDef`: the shape is declared here, the content
 * that feeds it is the Library, the heirlooms and the open Discrepancies.
 *
 * `House.chronicle: ChronicleId` was the original sketch for how a rival's
 * pages become buyable. It is not built that way: a `chronicle_page` lot's
 * `refId` names the Discrepancy it can prove directly, and `house` is drawn
 * from that Discrepancy's own `provableBy` list — the wiring issue #9/#10
 * already built. A second, parallel per-house chronicle document would be a
 * second source of truth for the same fact.
