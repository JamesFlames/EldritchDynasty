/**
 * THE DECISION LOG (issue #8, phase 1).
 *
 * `saveGame` / `loadGame` make a run a SNAPSHOT — loading is O(1), but a
 * snapshot says nothing about how the house got there. This is the
 * append-only record beside it: which choice, which outcome, who was cast,
 * which Record option, which child got which name. It is what lets the
 * harness bisect a balance change and what makes a bug reported eleven hours
 * into somebody's playthrough reproducible at all.
 *
 * A closed union ending in `assertNever`, on the same discipline `EffectS`
 * runs under: a new kind of decision is a compile error at its one consumer,
 * not a silent gap in the record.
 *
 * Deliberately NARROW. Only decisions with a genuinely EXTERNAL answer are
 * logged — one a human chose, or the chronicler chose on their behalf at a
 * specific moment. Everything else in a run (mortality, marriages, births,
 * the whole shape of a year) is already reproducible from the seed alone;
 * logging it too would make the log a second copy of the save rather than
 * the thing the snapshot is missing.
