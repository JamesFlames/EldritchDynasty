/**
 * THE CLAIM VOCABULARY (issue #19) — what a chronicle entry, a Record option
 * or a tale actually SAYS about a person, as opposed to what happened.
 *
 * Built last, deliberately: frame `reads` are discrepancy queries, the Record
 * challenge pool scores off `ChronicleEntry` as it stands, and tales key off
 * event ids — none of it needed a structured claim. By now, what an entry
 * claims is a matter of record rather than of taste, so this is a real,
 * closed union (attr / trait / death / deed) rather than another string.
 *
 * Authored against a slot `Target`, exactly like an `Effect` — a claim in a
 * `RecordBlock` or a `TaleDef` is instantiated once per firing, against
 * whoever was actually cast. `resolveClaim` in `core/src/record.ts` turns one
 * into a `ResolvedClaim` per person the target names.
