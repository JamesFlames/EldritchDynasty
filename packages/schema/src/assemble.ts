/**
 * WHERE THE CONTENT LIVES, declared once.
 *
 * There were two loaders — a node one walking the filesystem for the tests and
 * the harness, and a browser one over `import.meta.glob` for the editor — and
 * each carried its own copy of this table. When they drifted the symptom was
 * not an error. It was the editor quietly simulating a different game: a
 * missing `characterTemplates` line meant no spouses were minted, the line died
 * out, and the preview disagreed with the harness for reasons no one could see.
 *
 * Now both loaders do one job — hand over the files as text — and the layout
 * itself is here, next to the schema that gives those files meaning. A new
 * collection is one row in this table and it appears in both loaders at once,
 * because there is only one.
 *
 *   file       exactly this path; take `key` from it.
 *   dir        every .yaml under this prefix, recursively; concatenate `key`
 *              from each. Order follows the file listing, so authors can split
 *              a collection across as many files as they like.
