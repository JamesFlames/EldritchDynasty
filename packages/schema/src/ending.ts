 * condition evaluator once made an event fire unconditionally for a thousand
 * years, and a fall-through here would pick the same ending forever — which
 * would look exactly like a game with one ending.
 *
 * Three of the five cannot fire yet, for reasons outside this file: the rites
 * are not built (#43) and the ladder does not reach God in a measured run
 * (#41). They are authored anyway. An ending that cannot fire yet is a target
 * for those issues; an ending nobody wrote is not.
