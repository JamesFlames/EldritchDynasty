/**
 * INLINE FOLLOW-UPS, COMPILED TO ARCS.
 *
 * There are two ways to author a tree of events and there is exactly one thing
 * that runs one.
 *
 * An `ArcDef` is the full instrument: named nodes, guarded successors, a cast
 * that outlives the people in it, three hundred years of it. It is also a
 * two-file binding maintained by hand — the node table in `arcs/*.yaml` and an
 * `arc: { of, node }` block on every event that is one of its nodes — and for
 * the very common case of "and then, forty years later, this" it is far more
 * ceremony than the scene is worth. Authors were writing two unrelated events
 * and a `schedule` effect instead, which loses the cast: the follow-up recast
 * itself from scratch and the man the first scene was about was not in it.
 *
 * So `Outcome.next` is sugar, and this is where the sugar dissolves. Each chain
 * of `next` links becomes a real `ArcDef` with real nodes, and the root outcome
 * gains the `triggers: { arc, op: 'start' }` that `commitOutcome` already knows
 * how to honour — seeding the new instance's bindings from the cast the root
 * event actually resolved against, which is the whole point of `keep`.
 *
 * The root event is deliberately NOT a node of the arc it starts. It keeps
 * drawing from the ambient pool like any other event; only the follow-ups leave
 * it, and they leave it because `ambientPool` skips anything carrying an `arc`
 * block. That asymmetry is the design: the first beat is an event, and
 * everything after it is a consequence.
 *
 * WHERE THIS RUNS. `indexContent`, which every consumer goes through —
 * `bootstrap`, `validateBundle`, and the editor's `App.vue`. It writes into
 * `Content.arcs` and `Content.events` and never into `Content.bundle`, so the
 * authored bundle stays authored: the editor's write-back cannot serialise a
 * compiled arc back to YAML, and the arc editor can render compiled arcs
 * read-only by asking one field.
