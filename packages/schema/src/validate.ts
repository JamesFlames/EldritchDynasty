 * CONTENT VALIDATION, as a list of named rules.
 *
 * This was one 277-line function checking frequency obligations, slot
 * references, arc wiring, Age coverage, the Madness gate and the prose contract
 * in a single pass, in one scope, appending to one shared array. Adding a rule
 * meant finding the middle of it. Testing a rule meant running all of them
 * against the whole game and filtering the output by message text.
 *
 * A rule is a value now: an id, a sentence saying what it is for, and a
 * function from the content to its complaints. Three things follow —
 *
 *   the editor groups and counts by rule instead of by string matching,
 *   a test can run ONE rule against a two-event bundle,
 *   and an author reading a warning has a token to search for.
 *
 * Errors block a save; warnings do not, and that is deliberate. A linter that
 * stops writers gets turned off within a fortnight.
