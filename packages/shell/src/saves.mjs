 * WRITING A RUN TO DISK.
 *
 * `saveGame` produces a versioned, validated snapshot and `loadGame` rebuilds
 * a run from it that continues bit-identically. Neither has ever touched a
 * file: the shell owns the disk, and this is the part of the shell that was
 * missing. It owns no rules — a save is opaque JSON here, and `loadGame`
 * remains the only thing that decides whether a given blob is a run.
 *
 * Saves live under Electron's `userData`, never in the repository. A save
 * written into `packages/content` would be picked up by the next content
 * validation, and a save written next to the source would not survive
 * installing the application anywhere.
