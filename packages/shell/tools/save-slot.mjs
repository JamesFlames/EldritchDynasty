/**
 * THE GUARD ON THE SAVE DIRECTORY.
 *
 * `saveGame`/`loadGame` have round-tripped a run exactly for as long as the
 * save format has existed, and nothing has ever written one to disk: choosing
 * a slot and a directory is the shell's job, and the shell did not do it
 * (AGENTS.md, "Known gaps"). This is the half of that job that has to be
 * right, kept separate from the fs calls and from Electron so it can be tested
 * without either.
 *
 * A slot name is typed by a player, which makes it the second untrusted string
 * this application takes from outside itself. `content-path.mjs` guards the
 * first one and is the model here, with one difference that matters: a content
 * path is a PATH, and may name a subdirectory, so it is checked after
 * resolution. A slot is a NAME. Nothing about "the autumn run" wants a
 * separator in it, so the name is checked before it is ever joined to
 * anything, and the containment check afterwards is the belt to that braces.
 *
 * The extension is ours, not the player's. A slot called `notes.txt` is a save
 * file called `notes.txt.edsave.json`, which is the only way a listing can
 * tell its own files from whatever else is in the directory.
