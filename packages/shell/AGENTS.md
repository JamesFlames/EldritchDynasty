# shell — the desktop wrapper

Electron wraps the already-built `@ed/client` application and, in Mod Editor
mode, hosts `@ed/editor` against the same disk boundary. Both modes have a
Windows package; the game remains the default target. This package owns the
window, the menu bar and the disk. It owns no
game rules, no simulation state, and no duplicate client/editor UI —
`main.mjs`'s own header says the same thing about the runtime half of this
package, and packaging is held to it too.

## The seam

`src/renderer-entry.mjs` resolves where `index.html` lives for either web
application: its own `dist` inside the repository in dev, or the one staged
`process.resourcesPath/renderer` once packaged. `scripts/dist-windows.mjs`
stages `client/dist` by default and `editor/dist` for `--mod-editor`, so there
is one electron-builder configuration rather than two copies that can drift.
The game client remains the default.
It is split out of `main.mjs` — which imports `electron` at module scope and
so cannot be loaded outside an Electron process at all — so it stays a plain
function over plain values, testable with nothing but node
(`renderer-entry.test.ts`).

Saves are opaque JSON, written under Electron's `userData` by `src/saves.mjs`.
`SavedGameS` in core is still the only authority on whether a blob is a run;
this package checks exactly one thing about one — that `format` is a number.

## Commands

```bash
npm run shell            # the game, live against the client's dev server
npm run mod-editor --workspace @ed/shell  # editor; writes only <userData>/mods/content
npm run shell:preview    # build the client, then run the shell against dist
npm run smoke --workspace @ed/shell   # boot, assert the renderer mounted, round-trip a save
npm run build:shell      # Windows game: build client, package NSIS, smoke win-unpacked.
npm run build:mod-editor # Windows Mod Editor (#75): build editor, package the second NSIS
                          # target through the SAME builder config, smoke its mode.
                          # Both are unsigned unless CSC_LINK/CSC_KEY_PASSWORD are set.
                          # The tagged game release job supplies those secrets and
                          # refuses to ship unsigned rather than doing it quietly.
```

## Boundaries

- `electron-builder.yml` is the single packaging configuration for both Windows
  targets, and packaging owns no rules either: it moves bytes into an installer
  and nothing more. `.renderer/` is temporary staging and must never become a
  second checked-in build output. macOS and Linux are out of
  scope (#103), not deferred — do not add a `mac:` or `linux:` block without
  reopening that decision.
- `extraResources` in that file copies the staged renderer and one small guard
  module (`content-path.mjs`, shared with the editor's dev-server bridge) into
  the packaged `resources` directory. Nothing else from outside this package
  ships — a packaged build carries no repository content paths at runtime.
- `dist-windows.mjs` calls electron-builder's own Node API rather than
  spawning its CLI, and is never invoked as an `npm run` script from
  `check.yml` — see its own header and `tools/land.mjs`'s `ciScripts` for why:
  packaging a Windows installer has no part in an ordinary landing. On Windows,
  it then runs the freshly-built `win-unpacked` application with `--smoke`;
  the tagged release job therefore verifies the installed resource path and
  real preload/save bridge before it uploads the installer.
