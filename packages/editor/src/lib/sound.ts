/**
 * THE SOUND, WHICH IS SPARSE ON PURPOSE.
 *
 * The concept brief (§24) allows four sounds: page turn, seal, bell, and an
 * ambient drone that shifts by Age — and says the 2042 frame "kills the drone
 * entirely". Three more earn their place because the player needs to know
 * which way an outcome went without reading first: a boon, a blow, and the
 * plain note for the outcome that did neither.
 *
 * That is the whole budget. Seven cues in a thousand-year run, and six of them
 * are under a second. If you are here to add an eighth, the question to answer
 * first is which of these you are willing to take out.
 *
 * ── Why it is synthesised and not sampled ────────────────────────────────
 * Two reasons, and the second is the real one.
 *
 * The built page ships under a Content Security Policy with `default-src
 * 'self'` (see `vite.config.ts`), so a `data:` audio URI does not load and a
 * CDN does not either. Nothing to sample from.
 *
 * And the sigils are procedural for a reason — one artist, infinite
 * characters. The sound is the same bargain: nobody has to record a bell, the
 * bell is described, and describing it means it can be TESTED. A wav file that
 * plays silence is a wav file that plays silence forever. A `Score` with a
 * gain of zero fails `sound.test.ts` in three milliseconds.
 *
 * ── The shape ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Everything above `Sound` is pure data. `cueScore` and `droneScore` describe
 * what should be heard; `Sound` is the only thing that touches `AudioContext`,
 * and it is thin enough to read in one sitting. The tests never construct one.
