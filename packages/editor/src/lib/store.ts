/**
 * THE WRITE-BACK STORE (issue #20).
 *
 * `writeFile` and `toYaml` existed with zero callers. Every editing surface
 * kept its own local `ref` copy of its slice of content, rebuilt fresh from
 * `props.content` on every mount — which is exactly what `App.vue`'s
 * `v-if`/`v-else-if` tab chain does to a component on every switch. An edit
 * therefore survived until the next click.
 *
 * The fix is a module-level singleton. `reactive(bundle)` hands every
 * importer the SAME proxy, so `EventEditor` and `CharacterEditor` read and
 * write one shared model instead of three private ones, and `App.vue`'s
 * `content` (built by `indexContent`-ing this same `bundle`) sees every edit
 * immediately because it is the identical array, not a snapshot of it.
 *
 * SAVING is comment-preserving AT THE FILE LEVEL. Each content file is
 * parsed once into a `yaml.Document` — not just plain JSON — kept alongside
 * the reactive model. A save patches ONLY the changed item's node
 * (`doc.setIn`) rather than re-stringifying the whole file, so the file's
 * header comments and every OTHER entry in it survive untouched.
 *
 * The edited item itself re-serializes from its live, Zod-parsed state —
 * which means every field on it, not just the one a click actually changed:
 * optional fields Zod filled in with their schema default become explicit,
 * and arrays that were authored in flow style (`tags: [a, b]`) come back
 * block-style. The diff view (issue #21) exists largely BECAUSE of this —
 * it shows the author the real write, including the reformatting, before
 * anything reaches disk, rather than promising a minimal diff this design
 * cannot honestly make. A surgical single-field patch would need the live
 * model to track original source order and style per field; that is a
 * larger change than write-back itself and is left for a later pass.
