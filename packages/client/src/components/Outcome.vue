 * WHAT THE ANSWER DID (issue #84).
 *
 * The middle beat of the only loop this game has: decide → see what it did →
 * decide again. It was not implemented. `resolveChoice` returned the rendered
 * outcome prose — the authored sentence with the slots filled — and the store
 * dropped it, so a five-sentence dilemma somebody wrote carefully was answered
 * and the panel was replaced by the next dilemma. 304 times a run.
 *
 * It stands where the decision stood, because that is the whole point: the
 * consequence did reach the chronicle, as one unhighlighted line at the top of
 * a reversed sixty-entry column on the far right of the board, in a year that
 * also carried births, deaths, assize responses and Age namings. Being on the
 * screen somewhere was never the problem.
 *
 * The register is the chronicle's, not the log's: this is the authored
 * sentence, quoted, and the only words this component adds are the ones naming
 * what the player said.
