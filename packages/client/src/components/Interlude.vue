 * THE ONE PLACE THE CLIENT COULD TRAP SOMEBODY (issue #58).
 *
 * A fixed full-viewport scrim at `z-index: 20` with no `role`, no Escape, and
 * no focus handling at all. Focus stayed wherever it had been — behind the
 * scrim, on controls a keyboard player could still tab to and still activate
 * and could no longer see — and there was no key that would close this. The
 * frame is quieter than the tale, and for them it was permanent.
 *
 * So: a real dialog. Focus moves in on open, is held while it is up, and goes
 * back where it came from on close.
