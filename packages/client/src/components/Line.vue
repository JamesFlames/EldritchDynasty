/**
 * THE SPINE (issue #56).
 *
 * The halls are the living household, and rightly: the dead leave, because
 * they are in the chronicle, which is where a family keeps its dead. The one
 * exception is §22's Vessel, who stays greyed with a mark that is not the mark
 * for death, and she stays exactly where she is.
 *
 * But that is the reason a player at 1400 had fourteen generations of
 * ancestors with no visual trace anywhere — the one screen that could show a
 * thousand years of a bloodline showed nine people, in a game whose whole
 * subject is generational.
 *
 * So: one line, one name a generation, the seal and nothing else. Deliberately
 * not a genealogy — the halls are the family, this is the spine holding them
 * up.
