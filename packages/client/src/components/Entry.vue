/**
 * ONE LINE OF THE BOOK, wherever the book is being read (issue #48).
 *
 * Three places draw chronicle entries — the panel on the board, the reading
 * pane, and the creditor's account on the last night — and they were drawing
 * them separately. That is fine right up until one of them is edited: the
 * accessible text for a blank went into the panel and not the epilogue, so a
 * screen reader met a described gap in one place and `&nbsp;` in the other,
 * for the same artefact, in the same run.
 *
 * FREQUENCY IS FELT HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. A tier is a rationing decision
 * everywhere in the engine; in the book it is typography, and typography is
 * the only form in which the player ever meets it. So `weight` is a class and
 * the stylesheet is the whole of the meaning.
 *
 * An omission is a DATED BLANK LINE, not a missing line. The blank is the
 * artefact — it is the most interesting thing on the page — and it is the one
 * part of this component that must never be tidied into nothing.

 * WHAT THE LINE ACTUALLY CLAIMS (issue #19).
 *
 * A recorded entry can assert things about people — an attribute, a trait, a
 * death, a deed — and those assertions are what the creditor checks on the
 * last night. They have been on the read model since #19 and nothing drew
 * them, which `view.test.ts` caught the moment a claims-bearing entry
 * happened to land in its sampled window.
 *
 * Said in the family's own register, not as a data readout: the house does
 * not think of these as fields. A `deed` already carries its own sentence, so
 * it is quoted rather than reworded, for the reason `passage.ts` quotes
 * `causeOfDeath`.
