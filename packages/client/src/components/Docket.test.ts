 * ── THE FIRST TEST THAT RENDERS ANYTHING ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `packages/client` is 3,350 lines of Vue and every guard over it was a
 * text-level one. `verbs.test.ts` greps the templates to prove each verb on
 * `GameSession` reaches something a player can click — a real and valuable
 * check, and one that cannot tell whether the click does the right thing,
 * because nothing had ever been rendered.
 *
 * `Docket.vue` is where that matters most. It draws THREE SHAPES — choice,
 * match, record — and `run.slow.test.ts` says why in its own comment: "a kind
 * that never fires is a branch of that template nobody has ever rendered —
 * the failure this repository has shipped four times, one layer up". That
 * suite drives a whole run and checks each kind is RAISED. Whether the
 * template then draws it has been nobody's assertion.
 *
 * ── THE FIXTURES GO THROUGH THE REAL SCHEMA ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every decision below is built with real content and parsed by
 * `PendingDecisionS` before it reaches the component. A hand-written fixture
 * that the schema would reject is a test asserting against a shape the game
 * cannot produce, which is worse than no test: it passes forever while the
 * thing it claims to cover changes underneath it.
 */

/**
 * A real authored choice event with at least two branches.
 *
 * The first cut of this also demanded a SLOTLESS event and found none — every
 * one of the 324 choice events in the game casts at least one role. It does
 * not matter: what the panel draws a cast control for is `decision.cast`, the
 * roles the PLAYER is asked to fill, and that is empty here on purpose so
 * these tests are about branches rather than about casting.

 * and "is the branch yours to take" is recomputed. So the fixture is parsed
 * by the real schema (which is what stops it drifting into a shape the game
 * cannot produce) and then given the view-only fields explicitly.
 *
 * Finding that out is itself the test doing its job: the first cut set
 * neither, the branch buttons did not render, and the reason is a field a
 * grep-level guard has no way to know about.
