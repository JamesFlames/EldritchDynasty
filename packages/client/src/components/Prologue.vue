 * point at a signing, and until this screen the signing had happened
 * off-screen to nobody.
 *
 * It is paced rather than dumped. The triad is announced — three things given,
 * three things owed — and delivered one beat at a time in ascending weight,
 * because the third is the one that hurts and it does not hurt in a list.
 * Nothing here is skippable by accident and everything is skippable on
 * purpose: the reader who wants the whole page can have it in three clicks.

 * their own life into a game about a family being eaten is a player whose bag
 * is simply empty, and every other thing on this screen still works.
 *
 * The rows carry no explanation of what the names are FOR. The screen asks,
 * the run answers, and it answers in about 1310 with a midwife. Printing "one
 * of these will be reused later" here would spend the whole effect before a

 * interaction in the game and the last beat of a set piece the frame refers
 * back to for a thousand years, and a player who filled in the house name,
 * scrolled down and found a dead button had been stopped without being told.
 *
 * `Docket.vue` already holds the rule: an unavailable choice is itself
 * information (§16), so it is shown greyed WITH THE REASON rather than
 * filtered away. The button stays disabled — this is the one page in the game
 * that must not be half-answered — and now it says what it wants.
 *
 * In the order they appear above, so the answer doubles as directions.
