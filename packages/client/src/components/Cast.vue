/**
 * WHO THIS GENERATION IS ABOUT (issue #44).
 *
 * The tree draws seventy people and a player asked to care about seventy
 * cares about none of them. This is the same household, read down to the five
 * or six the year is actually about, each with the one fact that is true of
 * them and of nobody else — which is the condition for attachment that the
 * game was missing. `cast.ts` decides who; this draws them and hands the click
 * to the tree, so the list is a way INTO the family rather than a second copy
 * of it.
 *
 * The wording is the engine's — the sentence AND the little label beside the
 * name. A client that wrote its own sentence per role would be inventing facts
 * about people, which is the one thing the record layer exists to stop; and a
 * per-role dictionary here is a hand-written copy of a closed union, which
 * quietly printed `sole_expresser` at the moment issue #86 doubled the roles.
