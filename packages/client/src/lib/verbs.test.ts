/**
 * EVERY VERB THE PLAYER HAS, REACHABLE FROM SOMETHING THEY CAN CLICK.
 *
 * This repository fails by doing nothing, and a client is the best place in it
 * to fail that way: a verb that is never wired looks exactly like a verb
 * nobody happened to use. `send` is the one to picture — name the party and
 * let what they are between them decide the branch. Leave it unwired and every
 * `party` decider in the content resolves through `letHimDecide` instead, the
 * game plays, nothing throws, and the finding arrives in month four.
 *
 * So the chain is checked in two links, and neither end of it is a list
 * anybody maintains:
 *
 *   GameSession's methods  →  called in `game.ts`  →  an action a template calls
 *
 * The first list comes off the prototype and the second off the store itself,
 * so adding a verb to `session.ts` or an action to the store fails this until
 * it is wired all the way through.
