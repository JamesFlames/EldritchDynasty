 * WHO THIS PERSON HANGS UNDER, ACCORDING TO THE BOOK.

 * dowry moves the first and not the second, and a house that has bought itself
 * a grandmother should see the grandmother it bought. The truth is on the card
 * when you open it.
 *
 * The father where the hall holds him, the mother otherwise, so that a child
 * with both parents present hangs once rather than twice. A hall is not a
 * house (invariant 15): the parent may be alive in another hall entirely, in
 * which case the child is a root of this one, which is exactly what a cadet
 * branch looks like from the inside.

/**
 * A MARRIAGE IS AN EDGE (issue #56).
 *
 * The tree nests by parentage, so a spouse married in from another house had
 * no parent here and became a ROOT — a row of her own, between two of the
 * house's children, joined to her husband by nothing but a line of text
 * inside a card nobody had opened. In a game whose most consequential
 * recurring decision is who marries whom.
 *
 * So a spouse who is only a root because she married in is drawn beside her
 * husband instead of beneath nobody.
 *
 * ── THE THING THIS MUST NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Lose anybody. Children hang off `recordedParent`, which answers with the
 * father where the hall holds him and the mother otherwise — so the parent a
 * child hangs under may well be the married-in one. Attach her to her husband
 * without moving her children and her descendants leave the tree silently,
 * which is this repository's failure mode with a family in it.
 *
 * Hence two rules, and the second is the one doing the work:
 *
 *   - She is attached only when her husband is NOT himself a root, so exactly
 *     one of the pair anchors the row and the anchor is the one with blood in
 *     this hall.
 *   - `children` returns the children of BOTH of them. Whoever the record
 *     hangs a child under, the child appears under the couple.
