/**
 * THE TREE, WITH MARRIAGES IN IT (issue #56).
 *
 * A game about a bloodline drew a bloodline with no marriages: the tree nests
 * by parentage, so a woman married in from another house had no parent here,
 * became a root, and sat between two of the house's own children as an
 * unrelated row — joined to her husband by a line of text inside a card
 * nobody had opened.
 *
 * The first test below is the one that matters. Pairing people up means
 * choosing not to draw somebody on a row of their own, and children hang off
 * whichever parent the RECORD names — which may well be the married-in one. Do
 * this carelessly and a woman's descendants leave the tree without a sound,
 * which is this repository's failure mode with a family in it.
