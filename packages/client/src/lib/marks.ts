/**
 * THE FIVE MARKS, AND WHAT THEY SAY (issue #107).
 *
 * ✦ ◈ ◇ ☾ ✎ ⊘ are the entire visual language of the family tree, and every
 * one of them carried its meaning in a `title` attribute and nowhere else.
 * There is no hover on a phone. A player there met six glyphs scattered
 * through eighty-eight cards with no way, anywhere in the game, to learn what
 * a single one of them meant — and nothing about that looked broken, which is
 * how it survived.
 *
 * So the meanings live here, once, and three things read them: the card draws
 * the glyph, the same string goes on `aria-label` for a screen reader, and
 * `App.vue`'s legend prints the whole table where a thumb can reach it. A
 * tooltip is a fine third channel. It was never a first one.
 *
 * `touch.test.ts` fails the build on a `title` whose text has no other route
 * to the player, so a seventh mark cannot arrive the way the first six did.
