/**
 * THE KEYBOARD (issue #58).
 *
 * A game made entirely of text and buttons, played on a keyboard-shaped
 * device, that required a mouse for every single input. `grep -rn "@keydown"`
 * over the whole package returned nothing.
 *
 * The mapping is here, as a pure function over a description of the press,
 * because the interesting part is not the wiring but the four cases where a
 * shortcut must NOT fire — and every one of them is a bug you only find by
 * having somebody type their house name and watch the clock jump.
