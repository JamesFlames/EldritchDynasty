/**
 * HOVER IS NOT A CHANNEL (issue #107).
 *
 * The touch corollary to #58's seen-or-heard. Ten `title` attributes carried
 * meaning that existed nowhere else on the screen, and there is no hover on a
 * phone: five of them were the entire visual language of the family tree, so a
 * player on Android met ✦ ◈ ◇ ☾ ✎ ⊘ scattered through eighty-eight cards with
 * no way, anywhere in the game, to learn what one of them meant.
 *
 * Nothing about that looked broken. The tree drew, the cards drew, the marks
 * drew — this repository's failure mode, in the one place where the failure is
 * a player quietly not understanding the game.
 *
 * `styles.css` had already written the reasoning down for the neighbouring
 * case: "an omitted chronicle line is a ruled blank on the page and has to be
 * a sentence to a screen reader, because `&nbsp;` with a title on it is
 * nothing at all to one." The same sentence is true of a thumb. The principle
 * was written and then applied to exactly one of the two channels that needed
 * it.
 *
 * SO THE RULE IS: a `title` may never be the only place a piece of text
 * appears. It is a fine third channel — this is not a removal — but the
 * meaning has to reach a player with no pointer some other way, as visible
 * text, as an `aria-label`, or as the same expression drawn elsewhere in the
 * same template. Neither end of that is a list anybody maintains: the titles
 * come off the files, and so does everything that answers them. A hand-kept
 * list of ten tooltips is a list that will say ten forever.
 *
 * IT IS A NET, NOT A PROOF, and it is worth knowing where the holes are. Run
 * against the templates as they stood before this issue it caught eight of the
 * ten. It missed the gauge, which already had an `aria-label` and was never
 * lost to a screen reader — and it missed `title="the seal"`, because the
 * words "the seal" also appear in the button that opens the line of succession
 * three lines further down. A text match cannot tell an explanation from a
 * coincidence. That is what the legend test below is for: the marks are the
 * case where being reachable is not enough, so they are checked a second time,
 * structurally, off the table they are drawn from.
 */

/**
 * `title="…"` and `:title="…"`, with the value as written. A FUNCTION, not a
