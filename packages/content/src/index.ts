/**
 * THE YAML IS PARSED ONCE PER CONTENT REVISION, NOT ONCE PER CALLER.
 *
 * `loadContent()` has 77 call sites across 54 test files and used to cost
 * 730ms every time. Profiled, 670ms of that was `yaml.parse` over the 74
 * files; Zod validation was 60ms and indexing 3ms. Vitest forks a worker per
 * test file, so an in-process memo alone would have bought almost nothing —
 * the repeat is ACROSS processes.
 *
 * So the parsed documents are cached to disk under a key that is a hash of
 * every file's text. Reading them back is ~10ms. Change a byte of content and
 * the key changes with it, so there is no staleness to reason about and
 * nothing to invalidate by hand.
 *
 * What is NOT cached is as important. `assembleBundle` still runs on every
 * load, which means `ContentBundleS.parse` — the Zod pass, and therefore all
 * 25 content rules downstream of it — still validates every time. The cache
 * holds parsed YAML and never a validated bundle: skipping validation would
 * save 60ms and let a bad edit reach the simulation looking fine.
 *
 * This is a module-level cache, which invariant 8 forbids for SIMULATION
 * state. It is not simulation state: it holds only the authored documents,
 * which are immutable by construction, and every caller still gets its own
 * bundle back because Zod rebuilds each object it parses. Nothing here is
 * reachable from a `WorldState`.
 *
 * `ED_CONTENT_CACHE=off` bypasses it entirely.
