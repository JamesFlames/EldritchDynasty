/**
 * FERTILITY OPTION B — the X-linked drag, prototyped behind a constant
 * (issue #26).
 *
 * `FECUNDITY_DRAG_COUPLING` ships at 0, and this file's first job is proving
 * that number is load-bearing: the loci exist, are linked to font, and
 * genuinely do nothing to a body's fertility at the shipped default. Its
 * second job is proving the MECHANISM itself is correct in isolation — via
 * `dragFecundityContribution`'s explicit-coupling seam — without ever
 * running the simulation at anything but the shipped default (INVARIANT 8:
 * no module-scope mutable state that could drift between runs).
 *
 * What this file deliberately does NOT do: run the "batches of two hundred,
 * turn the constant up, watch for the death spiral" gate the issue asks
 * for before shipping this live. Two hundred thousand-year runs per coupling
 * is a tool a human runs on purpose (`npm run gate:drag`), not a suite CI
 * pays for on every push. What this file DOES own is the claim that tool
 * rests on: that its synthetic k=0 bundle is the shipped game, exactly, so a
 * number it prints at k=2 is about the coupling and nothing else.
