 * never authored, never tested, never once executed in the history of the

 * string `'head'` out of `castSlots` regardless of which slot it was pointed
 * at, so it freed nothing on any slot that was not the Head's, and stripped
 * the seal from a VESSEL who happened to be holding it. See `scope.ts`.
