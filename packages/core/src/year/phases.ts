/**
 * A YEAR IS A LIST OF PHASES, and the list is the file.
 *
 * This was a hundred and thirty lines of straight-line code inside `stepYear`,
 * and its ordering constraints — several of which are load-bearing and were
 * discovered the hard way — existed only as comments beside the call that had
 * to come second. Adding a system meant reading the whole function to work out
 * where it went, and getting it wrong produced a working simulation with a
 * subtly wrong shape.
 *
 * Now the shape of a year is data. Three things follow:
 *
 *   ORDER IS STATED.        Each phase says what it must come after and why.
 *                           `year.test.ts` reads `after` and checks the table
 *                           against itself, so a reorder that breaks a stated
 *                           dependency fails a test rather than a playthrough.
 *
 *   PHASES RUN ALONE.       A phase takes `(ctx, rng, report)` and nothing
 *                           else, so a test can run `births` against a hand-made
 *                           world without simulating four centuries to reach the
 *                           state it wanted.
 *
 *   RANDOMNESS IS PER PHASE. Every phase draws from its own stream, derived
 *                           from (seed, year, phase name). One shared year-RNG
 *                           meant inserting a single `rng.bool()` anywhere
 *                           shifted every subsequent draw in the year, so no
 *                           refactor could preserve a run and no golden could
 *                           be trusted. Now a phase's dice depend on that
 *                           phase's name and nothing else.

 * pooled over exactly those people decides, exactly as it would have for the
 * player. Picking a branch at random instead would mean an event that delegates

 * harness, which is the drift invariant 9 exists to prevent.
 *
 * Only a `player` decider falls past that line, and there the chronicler picks.

 * to the full list only when NOTHING is open, because a decision with no legal
 * answer still has to resolve rather than stall the year.
