/**
 * WHAT THE YEARS DID, AS VALUES (issue #49).
 *
 * `stepYear` has always returned a full account of every year it turned, and
 * no client has ever read one: `session.advance()` handed back `YearReport[]`
 * and `packages/client` threw it away, so pressing "a generation" moved the
 * clock twenty-five years in total silence. This is the same account, folded
 * down to the shape a client can actually draw.
 *
 * It is a MAPPING, not a second record. Nothing here decides anything, nothing
 * here is stored, and it draws from a report that has already happened.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS IN IT, AND WHY IT IS ONLY THIS ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Births, deaths and awakenings, and nothing else. That is not a first slice
 * of a longer list: it is everything a year does to this family that **the
 * chronicle does not already carry**, checked one at a time.
 *
 *   an Age being named   → `phases.ts` writes a `page` entry
 *   a cadet branch       → `branches.ts` writes one
 *   a clause recovered   → `scheduler.ts` writes one, in the contract's hand
 *   the Narrator crossing→ `phases.ts` writes an `illuminated` entry, and it
 *                          is the best-written thing in the game. Repeating
 *                          it here in eight plain words would be a way of
 *                          spending it.
 *
 * Every one of those is on the right of the board already, in the typography
 * its frequency earned. A passage log that restated them would be a second
 * place saying the same thing, one column over — and this codebase has spent
 * enough on second places that say the same thing.
 *
 * What is left is the demography, and the demography is exactly what vanishes.
 * **Nobody in this family dying is recorded anywhere the player can see**
 * unless an authored event happened to mention it. A house can lose four
 * people and a generation of daughters across one jump and the screen will
 * differ only in that the tree got shorter.
 *
 * ── THE REGISTER ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Plain reportage. Not the frame, which is quieter than the tale and gets a
 * screen to itself; not the chronicle, which is written by somebody with an
 * interest. These are the years as they went past. The one flourish allowed is
 * `causeOfDeath`, which is authored where it matters and is already a phrase
 * rather than an id — "the blood, overflowing", "of the years, all of them
 * having been used" — so it is quoted rather than reworded.
 */
/**
 * A BOOK FINISHED CHANGED SIDES (issue #82).
 *
 * The list above used to carry "a book finished → `phases.ts` writes a `line`
 * entry" as a reason to leave studies out of this log. It was the wrong side
 * of the split and had never been argued for. Six to eight readers are
 * mid-book at all times, so it fired about three times a year forever: 2,902
 * of a finished book's 3,738 entries were one sentence about putting a book
 * back on the shelf, and the chronicle panel became a rolling window on the
 * last eighteen years, four-fifths of it study receipts.
 *
 * A study completing is what a family does with its afternoons — the same
 * kind of fact as a birth, and exactly what this log exists to carry. The
 * chronicle keeps the one reading a chronicler would write down: the first
 * time anybody in the house finishes that book.
 *
 * SERVICE ENDING JOINED IT for the same reason (issue #87). An employer dying
 * releases every retainer bound to him at once, and one `line` per servant
 * came to eleven of the sixty entries the chronicle panel draws. The house
 * losing four people out of one death is exactly what this log is for, and
 * the chronicle keeps only the endings the HOUSE caused: wages it could not
 * pay, and a man's will.

/**

 * log both read "she awakened", four words that in a game about who expresses

 * explain — that would be the chronicle's job, done in the wrong voice. It
 * reports the second thing that is true, in the same flat six words it
 * reports a death in.
 *
 * No pronoun and no second branch, deliberately. Everyone who wakes without
 * expressing is a woman today, because `rollAwakening` needs carried font and
 * a man with carried font expresses by definition — but §11's Forcing
 * rituals are not built yet, `awakening.forced` is the field waiting for
 * them, and the first thing they will do is wake somebody this sentence would
 * then be wrong about.
