/**
 * THE LAST NIGHT (concept §23, issue #39).
 *
 * The run had no terminus. `stepYear` was a clock and nothing stopped it, and
 * grepping `core` for 2042 returned comments about balance. The five endings
 * — where the whole thousand years lands — were prose in a brief and zero
 * lines of code.
 *
 * ─── The creditor reads the chronicle, not the world ────────────────────────
 *
 * §6 is explicit and it is the entire thesis of the game: *"a house that
 * recorded everything faithfully arrives poor in Respect and rich in
 * knowledge; a house that embellished everything arrives exalted, revered, and
 * unable to prove a single thing it needs to prove."*
 *
 * So selection runs off `world.chronicle`. `readTheChronicle` is the only
 * thing that decides, and the one fact it takes from outside the book is
 * whether anybody is sitting at the table to be read to — which is not a fact
 * about the house's achievements, it is a fact about the room.
 *
 * That distinction is testable, and `ending.test.ts` tests it: strip the page
 * that attests a rung and the ending changes, with `world.ascension` untouched.
 * A selector reading `world.ascension.best` would have built the systems game
 * and deleted the story one, and nothing would have said so.
 *
 * ─── Three of the five cannot fire yet ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The rites are not built (#43) and no measured run reaches God (#41). They
 * are written anyway: an ending that cannot fire yet is a target for those
 * issues, and an ending nobody wrote is not. #42 grades the distribution once
 * they exist.

 *   |---------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|

 *   | embellishes always  |  11 |  14 |  19 |  22 |  26 |
 *
 * A house accrues about nine of these just by living — events create
 * discrepancies whatever the player does with a pen — and the Embellish adds
 * about five and a half on top. So the number that matters is not "how many
 * lies" but "how much more than the ambient load", and EIGHTEEN is roughly
 * double it.
 *
 * What that buys, on the same batches: the house that records everything is
 * charged a rung in 5% of runs and the house that embellishes everything in
 * 35%. That asymmetry is the whole point — it is a TAIL on the house that
 * lied, not a slope every house slides down, and §29.7 asks for exactly that
 * shape rather than for a penalty.
 *
 * Only 0 and 1 are reachable today: the heaviest book measured carried 26.
 * Two is written anyway and `ending.test.ts` enters the branch with a built

 * that is a number that only ever goes up.

/**
 * WHAT THE CREDITOR HAS IN FRONT OF IT.
 *
 * Everything here except `livingBlood` comes off the chronicle. `attested` in
 * particular is the highest rung the BOOK names — not the highest the house
 * reached — and the two are the same only for a house that wrote everything
 * down and kept it.
 *
 * AND THE GAP RUNS ONE WAY ONLY, TODAY (issue #77). Over the 120 thousand-year
 * runs that issue measured, across three pens — records everything, the
 * chronicler, embellishes always — the number of runs in which the house
 * reached higher than its book attests is 0. `attested` equalled
 * `world.ascension.best` in every one, whichever way the Record block was
 * answered.
 *
 * That is structural rather than a bug, and the structure is checkable without
 * running anything: `entry.rung` is written in exactly one place in `core`,
 * by `tickAscension`, the year the house first stands somewhere new, and it is
 * written truthfully. Nothing else ever writes one. So the book can LOSE a
 * claim — a page greyed, a page omitted, a rung now unsupportable — and it
 * cannot MAKE one. The house cannot write itself onto a rung it never stood
 * on, which is the thing the word "embellish" most plainly describes and the
 * one place the record layer stops short of its own vocabulary: `Claim`
 * already covers `attr`, `trait`, `death` and `deed`.
 *
 * RESOLVED, AND THE GAP NOW RUNS BOTH WAYS (issue #77). An embellishment may
 * write the house onto ONE rung above what it reached, and only while it holds
 * `eminent` — the lie the world is prepared to believe. See `forgeableRung` in
 * `events/decisions.ts` for the two gates and why they are those two.
 *
 * So `attested` may now exceed `world.ascension.best`, and `substantiated`
 * never can: it is capped at the truth below, which is what keeps a forged
 * rung a claim rather than an achievement, and keeps Apotheosis — which fires
 * on a SUBSTANTIATED god — out of reach of the pen.
