/**
 * EVERY AGE REVEALS EXACTLY ONE CLAUSE (concept §18).
 *
 * This is the design's own answer to promise debt — "opening a thousand-year
 * mystery and paying nothing until hour eleven" — and it did not exist.
 * `ActiveAge.paid.clause` was in the schema and written by nothing;
 * `clauseBearing` was validated and read by nothing. Measured over a thousand
 * years a run recovered two clauses of nine, from the three authored events
 * that happen to grant one. The God rung needs seven. The ending the entire
 * game points at could not be reached, and no test, warning or log said so.
 *
 * Paid at NAMING rather than at onset, because a clause arriving in the
 * chronicle is how the player learns the Age was a real thing and not weather.
 *
 * ONE JUDGEMENT CALL, and it is worth stating. §18 says two things that this
 * simulation cannot both honour: "every Age reveals exactly one clause", and
 * "a run that reaches 2042 having recovered three clauses has a genuinely
 * worse endgame than one that recovered eight". The brief was written assuming
 * roughly nine Ages in a run; Ages are a hazard process here and a thousand
 * years produces thirty-odd, so paying every one of them hands over all nine
 * clauses by 1400 in every run and the variance the second sentence describes
 * cannot happen.
 *
 * So an Age pays its clause only to a house that is KEEPING RECORDS — one with
 * an archivist in service. That preserves both sentences (every Age pays a
 * house that can read it), it gives the archivist a reason to exist beyond a
 * wage line, and it makes the recovered-clause count something the player
 * caused rather than something the calendar did.
 *
 * PER-AGE ASSIGNMENT (issue #4). Every clause names the Ages that can reveal
 * it (`clause/ages`, CI gate 7, requires at least two apiece), and this draws
 * from the ACTIVE Age's own assigned set rather than the global weight order.
 * Which clauses a run recovers now varies between seeds, not merely how many
 * — an Age whose assigned clauses are already gone simply pays nothing this
 * time, which is why a clause-bearing Age's occurrence is not the same thing
 * as a clause reveal.
