 * Ages run at once in 49.4% of all years and none run in 20.1%, so an Age's
 * own span cannot be the verdict's window — reading it that way told 26.1% of
 * the chronicle's page/paragraph entries inside two ended Ages at once and
 * dropped another 28.6% inside none. What partitions cleanly is the CLOSING:
 * of 96 closings across those six runs, zero shared a year with another. A
 * chapter is the years between one closing and the next, named after the Age
 * that just closed — disjoint by construction, so nothing is told twice and
 * nothing is dropped.
 *
 * `chapterOf` is derived, the way `epilogueOf` is (`ending.ts`): nothing here
 * is stored, and a reload reconstructs the same chapter from the same
 * chronicle, the same succession record and the same people store.
