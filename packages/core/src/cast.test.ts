 * all of which look like a working panel from outside, which is this
 * codebase's whole failure mode.
 *
 * The second failure it guards is subtler and shipped: a panel that fills
 * every slot it has, every year, with the offices of a household. That one
 * also looks like a working panel from outside. It is checked here by asking
 * whether an ORDINARY fact can be crowded out by an unusual one, and in
 * `cast.slow.test.ts` by measuring how often each role appears across a
 * thousand years.
