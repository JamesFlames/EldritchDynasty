/**
 * THE ASCENSION LADDER (concept §22).
 *
 * This was not in the code. Grepping `core` for a tier, a rung or a gate
 * returned comments and test fixtures and nothing else. Six rungs are
 * specified — Touched, Adept, Hierophant, the Vessel, Demigod, God — and they
 * are what a player is supposed to be climbing for forty generations, and the
 * simulation had no idea they existed. The player's only answer to "am I
 * winning?" was a Respect tier that landed on exalted anyway and a clause
 * count that filled itself.
 *
 * ─── The scale problem, and why this file normalises ────────────────────────
 *
 * §22's gates are written on a 0-100 scale: Touched at 10, Adept at 25,
 * Hierophant at 50, Vessel 70, Demigod 85, God 98. The genetics produce
 * nothing of the kind. Measured over eight thousand-year runs, the highest
 * carried font anybody reached was 26.8 and the highest EXPRESSED power was
 * 17.6, because `channelCeiling` binds hard and binds early. On the raw scale
 * the second rung of six was unreachable in principle, and the top four were
 * not merely hard but arithmetically impossible.
 *
 * Two ways out. Move the genetics until the raw numbers happen to line up with
 * a prose document — which is tuning the most load-bearing system in the game
 * to satisfy a scale nobody chose. Or map the genetic quantity onto the real
 * one, which is what invariant 10 already says to do everywhere else:
 * *"anything mapping an attribute onto a real quantity centres on
 * `ctx.genetics.expected`"*, and *"a cap is not an effect: measure whether the
 * ceiling ever binds"*. It binds. Constantly.
 *
 * So `eldritchPower` is expressed power as a percentage of what the LOCUS
 * TABLE — which is content, and regenerable — can actually produce. A man at
 * the genetic maximum reads 100. §22's numbers then mean exactly what they
 * say, the genetics are untouched, and an author who adds a font locus moves
 * the ceiling and the ladder together instead of silently breaking one of them.
 *
 * ─── What is here, and what is not ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The rungs, their gates, and the house's high-water mark are here, measured
 * every year and readable by a client and by authored content (the `ascension`
 * condition). The RITES are not: the Vessel's named sacrifice, the Great Rite
 * and its Church sanction, and the God rite's unmaking of the elder are player
 * decisions with authored text, and they belong in content rather than in a
 * measurement module. Rungs four and up therefore gate on everything §22 asks
 * for EXCEPT the rite itself, and `rungGate` names the rite as the last
 * requirement so nothing pretends the ladder is finished.
 *
 * ─── Since then: the rites are answerable (issue #43) ───────────────────────
 *
 * Half of that is no longer true and the half that changed is the important
 * one. The three rites are still not measured here — what a rite DOES is in
 * `events/rites.ts`, and whether the house is ever asked is in content, which
 * is where both belong. What is here is that `gateFor` now READS the answer:
 * `Person.rites` records the acts a man has taken, so rungs four to six can
 * be reached instead of merely described. Before it, every one of those three
 * `return`s was unconditional, and the top half of the ladder was a gate with
 * no key — the same shape as §22's forty books asked of a game containing
 * twenty-one, one floor up.
 *
 * The Vessel is built. The Great Rite and the unmaking are declared, refuse
 * with a reason, and are named by their rungs — so what is missing is missing
 * out loud rather than by omission.

 * HOW MUCH OF THE THEORETICAL MAXIMUM A THOUSAND YEARS CAN ACTUALLY REACH.
 *
 * The first cut of this file normalised against `maxExpressiblePower` itself —
 * every font locus at its best allele, throttled by the best possible channel —
 * and that was the same mistake as §22's raw numbers, wearing better clothes.
 * Measured: the table's theoretical maximum is 66, and across six thousand-year
 * runs the highest carried font anybody reached was 26.8 and the highest
 * EXPRESSED power about 22. A scale whose top is 66 puts an ordinary expresser
 * at 17 and the best man in a run at 33, so the ladder's second rung was still
 * a coin flip and its top four were still unreachable.
 *
 * Invariant 10 is the rule that was being broken both times: *anything mapping
 * an attribute onto a real quantity centres on what the population actually
 * produces*, not on an arithmetic ceiling nobody stands near. So the scale is
 * anchored where forty generations of deliberate concentration can actually
 * reach, and the calibration is a measurement rather than an argument:
 *
 *   ordinary expresser   raw ~11  ->  EP ~37   (Adept's 25 is a real rung)
 *   a well-bred line     raw ~22  ->  EP ~74   (Hierophant's 50 is a goal)
 *   the best ever seen   raw ~27  ->  EP ~90   (Demigod's 85 is a tail)
 *   God's 98                          needs raw ~29, beyond any run measured
 *
 * That is the shape §22 asks for in prose: Adept typical by generation 3-5,
 * Hierophant "where most first runs die", Demigod a target rather than a
 * milestone, and God the terminal outcome a family has to be built for.
 *
 * Still derived from the table, so an author who adds a font locus moves the

 * §22's BOOK COUNTS — the second quantity in this file that was prose taken

 *
 * §22 asks one man for 3 books at Adept, 8 at Hierophant, 15 at the Vessel,
 * 25 at Demigod and 40 at God. **The game contains twenty-one spellbooks.**
 * Forty of twenty-one is not a difficult gate; it is a gate with no key, and
 * it typechecked for as long as the raw power scale did and for exactly the
 * same reason — an absolute count, written in prose, against content that was
 * authored afterwards to a different size (invariant 11).
 *
 * That is the same shape `ASCENT_REACH` was built to fix, so it takes the same
 * fix, including the mistake that file already records making once. Measured
 * over twelve played thousand-year runs at a bid ceiling of 600:
 *
 *   the catalogue                      21 books, 8 of them at threshold 0
 *   the shelf the house assembles      12.1 of the 21
 *   the best-read man of a run          7.0, and never more than 9
 *
 * So normalising against the catalogue itself — all twenty-one — would be
 * `maxExpressiblePower` all over again: an arithmetic ceiling nobody stands
 * near, wearing better clothes. The scale is anchored where a thousand years
 * can actually put books in ONE MAN'S hands, which is `BOOK_REACH` of what
 * exists, and §22's counts are then read as fractions of its own top of forty:
 *
 *   Adept's 3      ->  1 book    an ordinary reader has it; a rung, cleared early
 *   Hierophant's 8 ->  3 books   a scaled 2, floored by the 3 affinities beside it
 *   the Vessel's 15 -> 4 books   a well-read man is past it; the blood is not
 *   Demigod's 25   ->  7 books   exactly the best-read man of a typical run
 *   God's 40       -> 8 books   a living family library deep enough for the last working
 *
 * What that leaves standing at the top is the blood, which is what §22 says is
 * supposed to stop a house: measured across the same twelve runs, power 50
 * with 3 books happens in 1,899 person-years and power 85 with 3 books in
 * NONE. Books ration the bottom of the ladder and the font rations the top,
 * and before this they both rationed the top and one of them did it with a
 * number no content could satisfy.
 *
 * The lower counts are derived from the catalogue, so adding a spellbook

 * the affinity half is calibrated separately as one representative from each

 * §22's MIND, and the third quantity in this file that was prose taken raw
 * (issue #61).
 *
 * §22 asks the Vessel for `mind >= 70` and God for a mind that outruns a
 * Madness of 90. Both are read on the 0-100 scale §22 writes everything on,
 * and `attr(p, 'mind')` is not on it. Measured over 1,216 sampled expressers
 * across eight thousand-year runs:
 *
 *   every expresser        p50 19.4   p90 44.3   p99 62.7   max ever 81.0
 *   men holding Adept      p50 34.0   p90 55.0   p99 67.2   max ever 81.0
 *
 * So the Vessel's 70 sat above the 99th percentile of the entire population,
 * and rungs four, five and six had never been held by anybody in any measured
 * run. Same bug as `ASCENT_REACH` and `BOOK_REACH`, third instance, and it
 * typechecked for the same reason all three did: a number in prose, against a
 * scale the simulation was never asked to produce.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ANCHOR IS THE CENTRE AND NOT THE MAXIMUM ──────────────────────
 *
 * `ASCENT_REACH` takes a fraction of the arithmetic maximum. That cannot work
 * here: the table's ceiling for mind is 194.8 while `attributes.yaml` clamps
 * the range at 100, so the arithmetic maximum describes a person the clamp
 * forbids — `maxExpressiblePower` all over again, which is the mistake this
 * file already records making once.
 *
 * Invariant 10 gives the right anchor: anything mapping an attribute onto a
 * real quantity centres on `ctx.genetics.expected`, which is computed against
 * the range and therefore describes the population the CLAMP produces. A
 * thousand years puts 2.06x the expected mind in its 99th percentile and
 * 2.66x in the best man ever measured, so the scale tops out a little over
 * two — which puts §22's numbers where §22 wants them:
 *
 *   the Vessel's 70   ->  raw 47   about the top quarter of men holding Adept
 *   God's 90          ->  raw 60   near the 99th percentile of that same group
 *
 * Derived from the table, so an author who adds a mind locus moves the ladder
 * with it rather than silently breaking it.

 * check them: a gate carrying its own copy of "the Vessel wants 70" is a

 * against content of a different size. Every one of them was a LINEAR rescale
 * of the whole ladder, and that is why each opened one rung and left the top
 * shut: **§22's ladder does not fit the population by scaling.**
 *
 * Measured. §22 spans 3.9x from Adept to God (25 to 98). The population spans
 * 2.25x, from an ordinary expresser at raw 11 to the best man in sixteen
 * played runs at raw 24.7. No anchor makes Adept ordinary AND God reachable at
 * once: pulling the scale down until 98 is clearable puts an ordinary
 * expresser at 45, a whisker under Hierophant, which is not the game §22
 * describes. So the fix belongs on the top gate rather than on the shared
 * scale, and the gates become data here so gate 9 reads the same numbers
 * `gateFor` does.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE POPULATION ACTUALLY REACHES ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two policies, because the answer differs and the weaker one is the wrong
 * calibration target — a house that never marries for blood is not the house
 * chasing Apotheosis:
 *
 *   climbing only          16 runs   best power ever 83   run-peak mean 70.8
 *   climbing + marrying in 12 runs   best power ever 90   run-peak mean 73.2
 *
 * Concentrating the blood is worth SEVEN POINTS at the ceiling, and that is
 * the measurement that decides this table. Against it:
 *
 *   hierophant 50   under both run-peak means — most runs get a man here
 *   vessel     70   at the run-peak mean — about half of them
 *   demigod    85   under the concentrating ceiling of 90. A tail, and a
 *                   REACHABLE one, so it is left exactly where §22 put it
 *   god        98   above everything ever measured under any policy
 *
 * So one number moves, and only one: God's. 88 is the top of the measured
 * tail — cleared by the best man of the best concentrating run and by nobody
 * else — which is what §22 means by the terminal outcome a family has to be
 * built for. Lowering it further would make God a rung rather than an ending.
 *
 * The other gates are NOT relaxed and must not be. Power is one of nine
 * things God asks for, and the conjunction is the difficulty; a ladder whose
 * every gate was individually easy would be a ladder with no top.

 * STAGNATION (§22, issue #43).
 *
 * > Demigod Stagnation: a Discontent counter rising while he stays Head,
 * > seeding Insurrection events inside the family.
 *
 * A man near the top of the ladder does not die on schedule and does not let
 * go, and the house below him fills up with people whose turn was supposed to
 * have come. `headSince` has measured tenure rather than age since it shipped,
 * *for exactly this*, and nothing read it for this until now.
 *
 * ─── Why it is not gated on `demigod`, which is what §22 names ──────────────
 *
 * Because rung five is not reached in forty played runs, and content gated on
 * a rung nothing reaches is content that is not in the game — the mistake this
 * issue's own Depends-on warned about, and the one the Great Rite made once
 * already by gating itself behind the Vessel.
 *
 * So it is gated on the ladder's TOP HALF and the pressure SCALES with the
 * rung: a man at the Vessel who will not get out of the chair is already the
 * thing §22 is describing, and a Demigod who does it is worse by exactly the
 * factor the rungs differ by. The day rung five is reachable this bites harder
 * with no line rewritten, which is the property `booksFor` has and the raw
 * numbers did not.
 *
 * ─── What it is NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not a rubber band. Invariant 13 reserves that for `assize.ts`, which is
 * explicit, announces itself, and reacts to how the house is doing. This is
 * the opposite: a fixed consequence of one fact about one man, and it does not
 * care whether the house is winning. It draws no dice, like everything else in
 * this file, and it writes one quantity that content can already read.
