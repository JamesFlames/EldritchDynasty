   * of the vow. The ordinary branch eight lines below it closes both, with a

   *
   * The three-line fix is deliberately NOT applied: it moves `npm run digest`
   * on 3 of 4 seeds, because it changes how long the widow is invisible to the
   * Match. That is a balance change and wants the harness and a BALANCE-LOG
   * entry, not a quiet correction on a test-suite branch.
   *
   * So this test asserts what the code DOES, and says loudly what it should
   * do. It goes red the day somebody fixes it, and the message tells them
   * that red is the good outcome — which is the only way a pinned bug does
   * not silently become the specification.
