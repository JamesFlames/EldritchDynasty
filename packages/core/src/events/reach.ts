/**
 * WHICH BRANCHES A RUN ACTUALLY REACHES.
 *
 * The frequency ledger counts TEMPLATE fires, which is what gate 4 measures
 * and what `world.frequency.templateFires` exists for. It has nothing to say
 * about the shape underneath a template: an event that fires in 85% of runs
 * can still have a choice nobody has ever been offered, because `requires`
 * reads attributes off the people cast in that particular year, and a check
 * band nobody has ever cleared, because the difficulty sits above what the
 * population produces.
 *
 * Both are invisible to every other instrument in the codebase. They are not
 * statically impossible — `outcomes/weights` is right to pass them — and they
 * do not dent the event's fire rate. The only way to see them is to run the
 * game and look at what was decided, which `world.decisionLog` already records
 * in full because replay (issue #8) needed it to.
