/**
 * THE RITES OF THE LADDER (concept §22, issue #43).
 *
 * Three of the six rungs are not measurements. §22 gates them on an act — the
 * Vessel's living sacrifice, the Great Rite the Church sanctions or is defied
 * over, and the unmaking of a living Demigod — and `ascension.ts` has said so
 * since it shipped: *"rungs four and up therefore gate on everything §22 asks
 * for EXCEPT the rite itself, and `rungGate` names the rite as the last
 * requirement so nothing pretends the ladder is finished."*
 *
 * This is where the acts live. They are in the ENGINE and not in content
 * because what a rite does is a rule about bodies and blood, the way `kill`
 * and `conceiveChild` are: an author decides whether the house is asked, on
 * what terms, in what words, and what the record says afterwards. Any of that
 * is a decision. How much of a consumed woman arrives in the man who consumed
 * her is not.
 *
 * ─── What was there before ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `the_vessel_rite` has been in `events/rites.yaml` since the content pass,
 * and it said all of this in prose. Mechanically it was a `status` effect and
 * a flat `madness: 35`:
 *
 *   - nobody's attributes moved, so §22's *"their attributes are added to the
 *     ascendant's"* was a sentence in a body;
 *   - the Vessel's OWN Madness went nowhere, so *"transfers in full and
 *     uncapped"* was decoration and the safe-versus-gifted choice the event
 *     offers was two flavours of the same outcome;
 *   - `status: vessel_consumed` was written straight onto the person, which is
 *     a second death gate wearing a different word (invariant 2) — no marriage
 *     was closed out, no archive, and the Narrator would have been consumable;
 *   - and the man was left exactly as far from rung four as he had been before
 *     he consumed a relative to reach it.
 *
 * Which is invariant 11 in its purest form: a declared thing nothing read. It
 * typechecked, it fired, it wrote a good chronicle line, and the ladder above
 * it was unreachable in principle for as long as it stood.

 *
 * Four rules hold this together, and every one of them is load-bearing:
 *
 * **What he gains, he cannot pass on.** Everything lands in `Person.acquired`,
 * which `conceiveChild` never reads — a child is drawn from the GENOME, and
 * the genome is not touched here. That is §22's own reason: *"a family cannot
 * ascend by consuming its way upward; every generation has to be bred, and the
 * rite only decides who gets to spend what the breeding produced."*
 *
 * **The blood is wielded, not carried.** `carriedFont` is left alone, so what
 * the market prices and what a mother's meiosis draws from are unchanged, and
 * `withGift` raises only what the man can express — as far as his own channel
 * allows. Blood past his ceiling is not power, it is Madness. A man who
 * consumes the family's deepest carrier and has no channel to hold her buys
 * himself nothing but ruin, which is the shape §22 describes.
 *
 * **Madness transfers in full and uncapped, and only from someone who can
 * express it** (§10, invariant 1). A woman or a mundane son carries no Madness
 * to give — that is the same sentence as "she is the safe Vessel" — and the
 * gate is `canExpress` on both ends rather than a sex test.
 *
 * **`kill` is the only death gate** (invariant 2). The consumed go through it
 * like everyone else and come out the other side with a status that is not
 * `dead`, which is what the tree draws a different mark for.

/**
 * THE GREAT RITE (§22, rung five).
 *
 * > Church sanction, or open defiance.
 *
 * What it does to a body is widen the channel. `expression.ts` carries the
 * long version of why; the short one is that power is `min(font, ceiling)` and
 * Madness is `font - ceiling`, so every rung above Hierophant asked for more
 * expressed power than any channel in the game can pass, and the frontier
 * table in `BALANCE-LOG` has power 85 with three books at **zero person-years
 * in twelve runs.** Not rare. None.
 *
 * Three properties hold this to the same rules as the Vessel:
 *
 * **It widens the room, it does not fill it.** A man with a narrow channel and
 * no blood behind it gains an empty room and nothing else — `expressedPower`
 * is still bounded by what he carries. That is what makes the two rites an
 * ORDER rather than a stack: the Vessel hands him more than he can hold and
 * the excess is pure ruin, and this turns the ruin he took on into the power
 * he took it on for. Taken the other way round it buys nothing.
 *
 * **What he gains, he cannot pass on.** `ELDRITCH_REACH` is in the acquired
 * layer, `conceiveChild` reads the genome, and the channel loci in it are
 * untouched. His sons are as wide as they were born.
 *
 * **It is charged for on the day.** The toll is Madness in proportion to the
 * room made — the rite is a violent thing done to a living mind, and a man
 * already close to his own `mind` can be finished by it. That is not a
 * decoration: `demography.ts` adds real mortality hazard above `mind` and
 * names the cause *the blood, overflowing*.
 *
 * The Madness it charges also decides WHEN the rite is worth taking, which is
 * the decision §22 wants a player to have. Rung five wants Madness of 60 and
 * no more than his mind. Taken early, the widening stops his overflow and he
 * never accrues the 60 the rung asks for. Taken late, the toll lands on a man
 * who has no room left for it. There is a window, it is his whole life wide,
 * and the house has to find it without being told where it is.
 *
 * INVARIANT 1 and 4: `canExpress` is asked and never set. The rite refuses a
 * man the genome did not already make an expresser, so this cannot become a
 * second door into the blood — and a house cannot schedule the gift by
 * widening a mundane son.

 * > The elder unmade to raise the younger, chosen or resisted, and the whole

 *
 * §22's terminal irony is built into `gateFor` already: rung six needs a
 * living Demigod AND somebody separate who exceeds him, so a dynasty that
 * concentrates everything into one perfect patriarch cannot ascend at all. The
 * unmaking is how that knot is cut — the house takes the elder apart to let
 * the younger past.
 *
 * ─── What it takes, and why it is not the Vessel again ──────────────────────
 *
 * The Vessel takes what somebody was BORN with: their attributes, their
 * carried font, the blood their mother's mother put in them. The unmaking
 * takes what somebody was MADE into — the acquired layer itself, the gift of
 * every Vessel he ever consumed and the room every Great Rite ever made for
 * him. That is the whole distinction between the two acts and it is why the
 * elder has to be somebody who climbed: a man who was never made into anything
 * has nothing this rite knows how to take.
 *
 * It is therefore also the only rite that can move a widened channel between
 * two people, and it still cannot create one: what passes is what the elder
 * was given, and `withGift` asks the younger's own genome whether he can
 * express any of it (invariants 1 and 4).
 *
 * ─── Losable at the final step ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Not here. Whether the house reaches the last step is a weighted outcome in
 * content, because that is where the odds of a thing belong — this performs
 * the act that succeeds, and the failure branch is authored beside it, sets
 * `GOD_RITE_FAILED` and reaches the ending §23 wrote for it. The engine does
 * not roll: `commitOutcome` already did.
 *
 * INVARIANT 2: the elder goes through `kill()` like everyone else. Unlike the
 * Vessel he takes the ordinary mark for death, because this is not a thing the
 * house can pretend was a journey north — it happens in a hall, in front of
 * witnesses, and §23's ending is written from their point of view.
