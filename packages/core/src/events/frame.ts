/**
 * THE FRAME (concept §2, Layer 1; issue #13).
 *
 * Everything else in a year draws from `ambientPool` and answers to the
 * shared Frequency ledger. The frame does neither: it is filtered out of
 * `ambientPool` on the first line, and every gate after that line assumes an
 * ambient event, so this module is the frame's own small, separate copy of
 * "what can fire, and did it."
 *
 *   framePool    everything currently eligible: tier `frame`, not fired yet,
 *                every declared `reads` currently true — a named Discrepancy
 *                in a given state, read straight off `world.discrepancies`.
 *   frameDue     the cadence — "every third or fourth generation" as a
 *                minimum gap plus a yearly roll, not a Frequency tier shared
 *                with anything ambient (invariant 7's shape: rationing that
 *                shares a ledger with an unrelated system steals from it).
 *   selectFrame  due, and something in the pool — the two checked together,
 *                because a due year with an empty pool is not a firing.
 *   presentFrame resolves the two listener slots, picks an outcome the same
 *                way ambient narration does, and writes the interlude to
 *                `world.frame.entries` — NOT `world.chronicle`. The frame is
 *                2042 reacting to the record; it is not part of the record.

 * No two interludes closer than this.

 * roughly every thirty-eight years once it could no longer starve, which is
 * nearly twice what §5 asks for. A generation is about twenty-seven years and
 * §5 wants "every third or fourth", so the expected gap wants to be around

 * player would answer it: 2, 13, 15 and 3 interludes. Two of those players get
 * essentially no frame — no creditor, no rising dread in the present, and no
 * reason for the last night to land on anything. The frame is the promise the
 * whole tale is read against (§2), and a promise delivered on a coin flip is
