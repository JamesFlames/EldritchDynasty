 * SELECTION
 * =========
 * Three passes, in order:

 *   1. FORCED   arc continuations that are due, scheduled follow-ups, and
 *               clause reveals owed by the current Age. These consume the
 *               generation's event budget before anything else is considered.
 *   2. PRESSURE state-driven demands — high discontent, madness near overflow,
 *               an open Discrepancy near proof. Weighted, but drawn from a pool
 *               that only exists because the family is in that state.
 *   3. AMBIENT  weighted random from everything eligible, gated by FREQUENCY.
 *
 * Eligibility is two-phase for cost. The condition prefilter is cheap and runs
 * over the whole pool; slot resolution is expensive and runs only on sampled
 * candidates. A candidate whose slots cannot fill is discarded and the sample
 * is redrawn.
