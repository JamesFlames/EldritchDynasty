/**
 * The fastest structurally possible route from the entry beat to an ending.

 * Guards, outcomes and weights are deliberately ignored: this is a LOWER
 * bound used only to refuse an arc that cannot possibly finish before the
 * campaign does. If a guarded short exit later proves unavailable, the story
 * may still run long; what this refuses is offering (or starting) one that
 * was impossible at the moment it began.
 *
 * THE ENTRY NODE'S OWN `schedule` CONTRIBUTES NOTHING. `startArc` sets the
 * new instance's `dueYear` to the current year directly, never through
 * `scheduleNext` — the entry event fires the same year the arc starts,
 * whatever its own `schedule` field says. Every node reached AFTER the
 * entry has its delay counted from `scheduleNext(nextNode, ...)` in
 * `advanceArc`, which this walk mirrors by only adding a node's own delay
 * when arriving at it as a SUCCESSOR, never for `arc.entry` itself.
 *
 * Cycles contribute Infinity until an alternate exit is found. A story whose
 * graph has no terminal route is therefore not startable near (or before) the
 * term; content validation is still responsible for diagnosing the malformed
 * graph itself.
