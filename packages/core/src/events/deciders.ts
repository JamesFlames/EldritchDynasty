/**
 * WHO TAKES THE BRANCH — the evaluator for `schema/src/decider.ts`.
 *
 * There is one function, and both the player's path and the chronicler's go
 * through it, for the same reason `commitOutcome` is the only place an outcome
 * is applied (invariant 9). Two evaluators would be two sets of rules, and the
 * one that ran less often would be the one that was wrong.
 *
 * It does not apply anything. It answers one question — which branch — and
 * hands back the reason with it, because the reason is worth as much as the
 * answer. The editor draws it in the branch trace, and a player who watched his
 * house sell the north field without being asked is owed a sentence saying the
 * treasury was empty and that is what this house does when the treasury is
 * empty.
 *
 * EVERY PATH RESOLVES. A ladder no rung of which holds, a check naming a branch
 * that is not there, a `party` decider whose check was never declared — all of
 * them fall through to a weighted draw rather than returning nothing. A
 * decision with no legal answer still has to be answered or the year never
 * turns over, and invariant 9 means an unanswered decision stops the clock for
 * good.
