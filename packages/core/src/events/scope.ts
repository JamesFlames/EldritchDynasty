 * WHAT ELSE IS IN THE ROOM when a condition is asked or an effect is applied.

 * Almost everything in the vocabulary is a question about the WORLD — the year,
 * the treasury, how angry the third hall is — and needs nothing but `SimCtx` to
 * answer. Arc memory is the exception, and it is a deliberate one: `arcFlag`
 * asks what THIS RUN OF THIS STORY remembers, and there can be three runs of
 * three stories in flight at once. The question has no answer without knowing
 * which of them is asking.
 *
 * The alternative was promoting story memory to world flags, which is what
 * authors were doing and why the flag namespace filled up with
 * `seal_challenger_paid_1204`. A flag every event in the game can see is not a
 * story remembering something; it is the world remembering it, forever.
 *
 * Absent scope, the arc-shaped questions answer FALSE. Never true — see the
 * comment at the foot of `evalCondition` for what a permissive default costs.

   * slot casts for, and only the template knows that `VESSEL` casts
   * `family_member` while `HEAD` casts `head`. Absent the template the effect
