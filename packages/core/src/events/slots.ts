 *
 * A `relation` filter — "not the same man as HEAD", "a child of MOTHER" —
 * compares its candidate against whoever is already cast in another slot, and
 * `evalFilter` PASSES when that slot is still empty, because a comparison
 * with nobody is not a comparison it can judge. So a filter evaluated before
 * its counterpart is cast does not narrow anything at all.
 *
 * This used to sort alphabetically, with a comment claiming relation filters
 * would therefore see the slots they refer to. They saw them only when the
 * author happened to name them in alphabetical order, and four authored
 * events in the shipped content did not: `CHALLENGER` asking not to be
 * `HEAD`, `PUPIL` asking not to be `TUTOR`, `HEAD` asking not to be `SON`.
 * All four read as constraints and all four were inert — invariant 11's exact
 * shape, invisible without knowing the fill order.
 *
 * Dependency order fixes the constraint rather than the naming. Slots that
 * others point at are filled first; alphabetical order breaks every tie, so
 * resolution stays reproducible. A cycle (`A` not `B`, `B` not `A`) cannot be
 * ordered and falls back to alphabetical for the slots caught in it — one of
 * the two filters is then inert, which is what a cycle means, and
 * `slots/references` fails the build on one.
