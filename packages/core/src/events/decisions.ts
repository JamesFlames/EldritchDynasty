/**
 * THE RUNG THE BOOK MAY CLAIM AND THE HOUSE NEVER STOOD ON (issue #77).
 *
 * §6's thesis sentence has two halves — *a house that embellished everything
 * arrives exalted, revered, and unable to prove a single thing it needs to
 * prove* — and until this existed the second half was carried entirely by
 * Respect. The ladder was the one thing the family could only be HONEST
 * about: `entry.rung` was written by `tickAscension` alone, truthfully, the
 * year the house first stood somewhere new, so the book could lose a claim (a
 * page greyed, a page omitted, a rung now unsupportable) and could never make
 * one. Measured over 120 thousand-year runs across three pens, the number of
 * runs where the book said more than the house did was **zero**.
 *
 * Two gates, and they are what keep the ladder a narrative spine rather than
 * a number anybody can type:
 *
 *   ONE RUNG. Never two. The claim is always `best + 1`, computed fresh from
 *   `world.ascension.best` every time, so a house that embellishes forty
 *   times still attests exactly one rung above what it reached. The book can
 *   round up; it cannot invent a career.
 *
 *   CREDIBILITY. `eminent` is the floor, which is the same tier §22 asks for
 *   at the top of the real ladder. A house nobody has heard of does not get
 *   to write itself a Hierophant — this is the lie the world is prepared to
 *   believe, and an unknown house has no credit to spend on one.
 *
 *   AND IT MUST STILL BE STANDING THERE. `rung` is where the house is now;
 *   `best` is the high-water mark it is allowed to remember forever
 *   (invariant 14). The pen may only round up from a rung the house is
 *   holding TODAY — "our man was a step away" is a lie about a living man,
 *   and a house whose Hierophant died in 1300 claiming a Vessel in 1900 is
 *   not embellishing, it is inventing.
 *
 *   That third gate is not decoration, and it was added with a number. On
 *   `eminent` alone the book said more than the house did in 20 runs of 20 —
 *   the chronicler embellishes a fifth of the time and a thousand-year house
 *   is nearly always eminent by the end, so a forged rung was not a thing
 *   that could happen, it was a thing that always happened. #77's whole
 *   complaint was a gap measured at 0 in one direction; replacing it with a
 *   gap measured at 100% in the other is the same bug wearing a different
 *   sign.
 *
 * What it CANNOT do is reach the top by forgery: `readTheChronicle` caps
 * `substantiated` at `world.ascension.best`, so a forged rung is attested and
 * never substantiated, and Apotheosis — which fires on a substantiated god —
 * stays out of reach of the pen. That is asserted in `ending.test.ts` rather
 * than left to follow from this comment.
