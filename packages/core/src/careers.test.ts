 * THE DOOR THAT WAS NEVER CUT.

 * Everything above the last four suites in this file passed on the day issue
 * #16 was closed, and every one of them was testing a mechanism that worked.
 * The mechanism was never the bug. Nothing anywhere in the authored content
 * used the `career` effect, so `Person.career` was written by nothing: six
 * thousand-year runs, six and a half thousand people, not one post ever held.
 * A suite that reaches for `applyEffect` directly cannot see that, because it
 * is the caller the game did not have.
 *
 * `a run can reach every career` is the one that would have said so, and it
 * says it the cheap way — by reading the content rather than simulating a
 * millennium.
