 * ISSUE #45'S ACCEPTANCE, AS A JUDGMENT.
 *
 * `gate:bearing` plays 252 thousand-year runs and then makes one reading over
 * them: does the house the world remembers as carrying itself climb higher
 * than the house that kept its head down? Playing that batch is a
 * half-hour instrument, and none of it is what could go wrong with the
 * reading — so the reading is a function over runs, and this hands it two
 * distributions it must tell apart.
 *
 * That split is the whole reason `verdictOver` exists. A gate nobody has
 * watched fail is indistinguishable from a gate that cannot fail, and the
 * ladder gate's trick — hand it a declawed bundle — is not available here:
 * bearing's consequence lives in `marketAppetite`, in the engine, so there is
 * no authored charge to take away.
