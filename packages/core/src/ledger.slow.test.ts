// ISSUE #42, two findings.
//
// First: `closeTheLedger` firing mid-run — only newly reachable via
// `broken_line` — writes a closing-page chronicle entry hardcoded to
// `title: 'The Term'` (`ending.ts`), which collides with the Ledger clause
// of the same name. A healthy run reaching 2042 through this exact loop's
// own call count never triggers `closeTheLedger` at all (1000 calls from
// 1042 lands exactly on 2042, one call short of the entry guard), which is
// why the collision was never seen before broken_line made it reachable
// mid-batch. Fixed at the read site below — matched on TEXT as well as
// title, since the collision shares a title with a real clause and nothing
// else about it — rather than by avoiding doomed seeds, which would have
// fought the very next test: a house whose line breaks recovers visibly
// fewer clauses, and removing every such seed narrowed "does not hand every
// run the whole contract" to a 9-8 spread across twenty-six straight healthy
// seeds, no exceptions. 1042, 909, 5150 and 31 are kept as four known-doomed
// seeds that restore it; every other seed below is confirmed to survive the
// full thousand years.
