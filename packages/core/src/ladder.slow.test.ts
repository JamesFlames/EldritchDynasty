 * ISSUE #41'S SECOND HALF, PLAYED.
 *
 * `gate:ladder` is a function over a bundle rather than a script, for the
 * reason every gate here is: a gate nobody has watched fail is
 * indistinguishable from a gate that cannot fail. The negative it is handed
 * is not a contrived bundle — it is the game as it stood the day the issue
 * was written, with the ladder's bargains still offered and costing nothing.
