/**
 * THE CLAUSE-REVEAL RULES, ASSERTED DIRECTLY.
 *
 * `ledger.slow.test.ts` measures what a thousand-year run RECOVERS, which is
 * the right test for the balance and the wrong one for the rules: it takes
 * fifty seconds, and every one of its numbers moves when anything upstream of
 * the Ledger moves. When the economy bug was found — houses pinned to the
 * debt floor could not pay an archivist, so they recovered two clauses of
 * nine — every rule in `revealClause` was working correctly and the suite
 * still went red, because nothing separated "the rules are wrong" from "the
 * house was too poor to reach them".
 *
 * These do the separating. Each one builds the exact world state its rule is
 * about and calls `revealClause` once. They are fast, they do not care what
 * the economy is doing, and between them they pin every branch of the
 * function — so a future change that quietly drops one has to fail HERE,
 * naming the rule, rather than as a drifted median four files away.
