/**
 * ── IS A REMEMBERED RUN THE SAME RUN? ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `corpus.ts` reads a played millennium back through `saveGame`/`loadGame`
 * instead of replaying it, which is only sound if the world that comes back
 * is the world that went in. Nothing else in the repository asks that
 * question of a whole played run: `save.test.ts` round-trips a world built
 * for the purpose, and `digest` is computed FROM `saveGame`'s output, so by
 * construction it cannot see a field the format never knew about.
 *
 * THAT LAST GAP IS THE ONE THIS FILE IS REALLY FOR, and CLAUDE.md names it:
 * add a field to `WorldState` and `createWorld`, forget `SavedGameS` and
 * `saveGame`, and the field is not in the format, so it is not in the digest,
 * so every round-trip test still passes while the field silently resets on
 * load — "which looks exactly like a subsystem that stopped working two
 * centuries in".
 *
 * So the comparison here is between two WORLDS, field by field, not between
 * two saves. A field that never reaches the format shows up as a difference
 * between the world that was played and the world that was remembered,
 * because only one of them ever had it.
 *
 * The speed work paying a correctness dividend is the point: the corpus is
 * only worth having if this passes, and this passing is worth having whether
 * or not anybody wanted the corpus.

/**
 * A value with every object key in sorted order, Maps and Sets flattened, and

 *
 * Key ORDER is the one thing that legitimately differs. `JSON.stringify`
 * preserves insertion order, a live object gets its keys in the order the run
 * assigned them, and `loadGame` rebuilds them in schema order — so a played
 * branch serialises `…grievance, extinct, recalled` and a remembered one
 * `…grievance, recalled, extinct`, with identical values. Comparing raw JSON
 * reports all 541 people as different; comparing this reports nothing,
