   * times the declining column, `open` under half, `unsupportable` under a
   * third. Every one of those passed. All of them were measuring the bug.
   *
   * `gate:bearing`, seed set 4000+13i, 60 runs a column, found it. The top bin
   * is the house that carried itself proudly and embellished every block, and
   * across the commit that added this lane it went:
   *
   *     rungs reached      2.43 -> 2.43     it climbed exactly as high
   *     rungs PROVED       2.08 -> 2.43     and could suddenly prove all of it
   *     rungs withheld     0.35 -> 0.00
   *     unsupportable     15.4  ->  2.3
   *
   * A 95% answer to the bill is not an answer, it is an amnesty, and it took
   * §6's thesis sentence with it: "exalted, revered, and unable to prove a
   * single thing it needs to prove" stopped being a state the game could
   * reach. So the RATION was cut — three of the four scenes happen once each,
   * the man from Cawdry is a trade on a cooldown — and these assertions now
   * describe what the lane is FOR rather than what it was doing.
   *
   * The corrected shape, measured: a house that spends on burying every chance
   * it gets puts about five lies down across a thousand years and arrives
   * still owing about three quarters of the bill.
