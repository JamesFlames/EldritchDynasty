 * ── THE CI LANES ARE A PARTITION, AND THE WORKFLOW IS THE OTHER HALF ──────

 * timestamps in run 123's own log. `outcome-reach` and `vocabulary-reach`

 * `war` alone against everything else, and not a tidier-looking division

 *
 * `gatesInLane` DERIVES `batch` rather than listing it, so a gate added
 * tomorrow is in CI the moment it exists. That is deliberate, and it is the
 * argument `check.yml` has always made about iterating `GATES` instead of
 * naming gates in a workflow — gate 2 was written for CI and wired into
 * nothing for its whole life under the old hand-kept list.
 *
 * But deriving the default lane protects exactly one direction. Name a gate
 * into a lane of its own and forget to add that lane to the workflow's
 * matrix, and those gates run on NO runner at all while every build stays
 * green — gate 2's history again, wearing a matrix. So the workflow is read

   * workflow, which goes stale the moment somebody adds a gate and forgets
   * this file. A LANE is not that. Only `batch` and `war` are ever named, and
   * `batch` is DERIVED as every gate not spoken for, so a new gate is in CI
   * the moment it exists — the property the old rule existed to defend,
   * defended by construction rather than by a regex.
