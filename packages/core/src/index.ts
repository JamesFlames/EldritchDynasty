/**
 * `corpus.js` and `tools/mutate.js` are NOT re-exported here, on purpose.
 *
 * Both are Node-only tooling — `corpus.js` reads and writes the cache with
 * `node:fs`/`node:crypto`/`node:zlib`, `tools/mutate.js` rewrites source files
 * on disk — and `export *` makes a module part of THIS package's module graph
 * whether or not anything actually calls into it: a barrel re-export forces
 * the module to load and evaluate to know what it exports. The client imports
 * `@ed/core` for the simulation and nothing else, so the moment either of
 * these joined the barrel, Vite pulled `node:crypto` into the browser bundle
 * and the whole app failed to mount — `Cannot access 'node:crypto.createHash'
 * in client code` — silently, since a dev server that throws on first paint
 * still says "ready" in the terminal.
 *
 * Their few consumers (`corpus-warm.ts`, `corpus.slow.test.ts`,
 * `record.slow.test.ts`) import the file directly instead of through here.
