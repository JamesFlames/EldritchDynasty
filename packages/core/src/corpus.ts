/**
 * ── THE RUN CORPUS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Forty-three slow suites play whole millennia and every one of them plays
 * its own, from scratch, throwing away everything the others wanted.
 * `record.slow.test.ts` alone plays 240 runs of 458 years — 110,000 simulated
 * years — to make TWO assertions, and at 451 seconds it is the floor the
 * whole suite waits behind, because vitest parallelises per file.
 *
 * Measured on a four-core container:
 *
 *   one 458-year run                    2,207 ms
 *   saveGame + loadGame round trip        111 ms      20x cheaper
 *   the resulting save                    725 KB      97 KB gzipped
 *
 * So a played run is stored and read back instead of replayed. `loadGame`
 * returns a full `SimCtx`, which is what the suites already hold, so a
 * suite's `run(seed)` becomes a lookup and everything downstream of it —
 * `familySnapshot(ctx)`, `ctx.world.decisionLog` — is unchanged.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT A GOLDEN FILE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Nothing here is checked in and nothing is asserted against a stored value.
 * The corpus is a CACHE of a pure function: `(content, code, seed, years)`
 * fully determines the run (invariant 8), so the key is a hash of all four
 * and a stale entry is unreachable rather than merely unlikely. Change a byte
 * of content or of `core`, and every key changes with it. That is the same
 * bargain `@ed/content`'s parse cache already makes, deliberately mirrored,
 * down to the escape hatch.
 *
 * THE CODE HALF OF THE KEY IS THE PART THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG. Hashing
 * only the content would leave the corpus authoritative across a simulation
 * change — the suite would keep asserting against runs the current code no
 * longer produces, which is precisely the failure this repository is named
 * for, installed as infrastructure.
 *
 * `ED_RUN_CORPUS=off` bypasses it entirely and plays everything.
