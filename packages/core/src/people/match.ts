/**
 * THE MATCH — draft one partner from three cards.
 *
 * Step 2 of the core loop, and one of the three things the player actually
 * does. `autoMarry` said so in its own header for a year: "PLACEHOLDER
 * PAIRING. The shipped game replaces this entirely with the suitor draft —
 * draw one of three cards, each with blood, politics, a dowry and one secret
 * revealed later." This is that draft. `autoMarry` survives underneath it and
 * still pairs everyone the player is not asked about — the cadet halls, the
 * retainers, the married-in — because a game that asked the Head to arrange
 * every wedding in four hundred people's lives would be a spreadsheet.
 *
 * WHO IS DRAFTED FOR: blood of the main hall. Those are the marriages that
 * decide what the house is — a daughter of the seat married outward costs the
 * family her font and her children both, which is exactly the decision the
 * genetics was built to make expensive. A cousin in a cadet hall marrying
 * another cousin is a fact about the world; the seat's marriages are the game.
 *
 * WHAT IS ON A CARD: what the world can see. Her house, her age, what the
 * market says about her, the kinship the DOCUMENTS claim (`matchF`, which a
 * forged pedigree moves exactly as far as the forgery says it should), and
 * what she costs. Never the genome. The card cannot tell you what she carries
 * because nobody in 1042 can tell you what she carries, and the whole
 * marriage market exists because of that. It does carry a word about her
 * LINE — see `LineRead` — which is the one thing a market can honestly say
 * about fertility without counting anybody's eggs.
 *
 * WHY A CARD IS NOT A PERSON. Two of the three are declined, and a declined
 * suitor must not become a woman living somewhere else with a lazy genome and
 * a claim on the frequency ration. So a card holds a `MintRecipe` — everyone
 * she would be — and `mintRecipe` spawns her only if she is taken. The house
 * remembers the names it heard (`rollRecipe` reserves them), and nothing else
 * of a declined card reaches the world.

 * have as well as on what those children will be. A player who cannot observe
 * that is not making the bet; he is being charged for it. But the card must

 * births the world has already seen, and only out of women who lived through
 * the whole childbearing window: a completed life is the only kind anybody can
 * count. It is measured against the population's own mean rather than a
 * constant, for the reason `expectedAttribute` is: the locus table is content,
 * and a hardcoded centre stops being true the first time anyone edits it.
 *
 * It reads the RECORD, not the blood — a woman is her documents' daughter
 * here, exactly as she is for `kinship`. A forged pedigree that moves a girl
 * into a fuller line moves what the market says about her too, and the house
 * that paid for the forgery is the last house entitled to complain.
 *
 * `unknown` is the honest answer and a common one. A woman off a farm has no

/** A card the house cannot pay for is still dealt. Being unable to afford it is information. */
/**
 * WHAT SHE COSTS, and why the answer is not always "take the best card".
 *
 * `match.ts` has always carried a comment saying "the treasury is the reason
 * the answer is not always take the best card". Measured, it was not true:
 * 362 of 480 cards in a run were priced at 20 crowns, 108 at nothing, and ten
 * cards in the whole thousand years reached the 50 and 120 tiers. Against a
 * treasury that runs to several thousand by 1400, every card was free, so
 * every hand was a stat comparison with no cost on either side of it.
 *
 * Three things move the number now, and each is something the market can
 * actually see:
 *
 *   THE BLOOD.   A house known to carry charges for it. This is the price of
 *                the only thing the player is really shopping for, and it is
 *                the one premium the market can charge honestly — nobody can
 *                read her genome, but everybody knows what her house is.
 *
 *   THE LINE.    A full line costs more than a thin one. It is the other half
 *                of what a dowry negotiation was ever about.
 *
 *   YOUR PURSE.  A rich house is charged like a rich house. This is not the
 *                market being fair; it is the market being a market, and it
 *                is the reason a treasury of six thousand crowns does not
 *                make the marriage question go away.
 *
 * A cousin still costs nothing (`householdCard`). That is the trade the whole
 * design turns on: the free card is the one that concentrates the blood, and
 * the concentrating card is the one that kills children in the womb.
