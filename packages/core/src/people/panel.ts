/**
 * THE MATCHMAKER'S PANEL (issue #68) — WHAT IS OBSERVED, NEVER WHAT IS TRUE.
 *
 * The genetics is the best thing in this project and the player could not see
 * a single part of it working. The Match fires about once a generation, it is
 * the decision the game is named for, and it was made on three cards and a
 * hunch: a house, an age, a word about the line, a price.
 *
 * The fix is NOT to print the genome. `record.claimed` hides attributes the
 * chronicle has not spoken about for a good reason — a card that announces a
 * woman's Fecundity ends §7's marriage market in one line — and a world where
 * a bride's blood can be read is not this world. But the state this replaces
 * was the other failure: with nothing to reason FROM, the central decision was
 * made blind rather than made under uncertainty. Those two feel identical in
 * the moment and completely different over forty generations, which is the
 * whole argument for this file.
 *
 * So every row here is either a public fact or somebody's claim:
 *
 *   `issue`    Her mother and her sisters, named, with the children the RECORD
 *              credits to them and how many of those grew up. The marriage
 *              market already reads a LINE off exactly this rather than off a
 *              genome (`LineRead`), so the data is what the simulation itself
 *              uses; the panel simply stops summarising it into one word.
 *   `woken`    Her near kin the world has watched wake (§11). This is the one
 *              honest signal in a market otherwise built on forged documents,
 *              and it is honest because it is a life event a hall full of
 *              people saw, not a number off a locus table.
 *   `said`     What is said of her house, by a named teller with a named
 *              motive. Some of it is wrong. The panel never says which.
 *   `ourBook`  What THIS family's own chronicle has previously written about
 *              her house — including the pages it embellished. A house that
 *              lied about the Marrows two centuries ago has to act on its own
 *              lie, which is the record layer finally charging somebody.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ON THE CARD AND NOT COMPUTED AT VIEW TIME. A card is a promise
 * already made — the file comment on the saved hand says so, and it is why a
 * recipe is stored whole rather than re-rolled on load. The panel is what the
 * market could see ON THE DAY THE HAND WAS DEALT. Recomputing it when the
 * client happens to look would quietly answer a different question, and the
 * clock is parked while the docket is open anyway, so the two agree until the
 * moment they would not.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. No `accuracy`, for the reason `circulatingTales`
 * gives at length: the game does not adjudicate between two contradicting
 * accounts in its own voice, and a client handed `accuracy` could sort the
 * accounts by truth. No attribute, no font, no fertility number, no locus. If
 * a value here cannot be traced to a birth somebody counted, a waking somebody
 * attended, or a sentence somebody wrote down with their name on it, it does
 * not belong on the panel.

/**
 * WHO OF HERS HAS WOKEN.

 * The Power is X-linked and given (invariant 4): a daughter takes her father's

 * where the Power has SHOWN in a woman's near kin is not gossip about her
 * family, it is the closest thing to a reading of her own blood that anybody
 * in 1042 can take — and §11 says as much, calling the early-waking daughter
 * "the one honest signal in a marriage market otherwise built entirely on
 * forged documents". A waking is a thing a hall full of people attended. It is
 * on the panel because it is public, not because it is true.
 *
 * HER KIN, TO FIRST COUSINS. Two steps up the CLAIMED pedigree and back down
 * again: father, mother, siblings, grandparents, uncles and aunts, cousins.
 * That is the family a matchmaker actually knows, and the first cut of this
 * read only her father, her siblings and her mother's brothers — which came up
 * empty on 84 of 118 household cards measured, because her father married in
 * from a house with no font in it and her brothers are three coin flips. The
 * branch is the unit the market reads, and it always was: "it has shown twice
 * in that line" is a sentence somebody says.
 *
 * Claimed, never real, for the same reason `kinship` and `LineRead` are: the
 * market reads documents. A forged pedigree that moves a girl into a branch
 * the Power has shown in moves what the market believes about her, and the
 * house that bought the forgery is the last house entitled to complain.
 *
 * For a recipe there are no relatives, because two of the three people on the
 * table do not exist yet. What there is instead is her house: the people of it
 * the world HAS watched wake. A house that has produced three wakings in two
 * centuries is a different proposition from one that has produced none, and
 * nobody had to open a genome to notice.
