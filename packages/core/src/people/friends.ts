/**
 * THE FIVE NAMES THE PLAYER GAVE AT THE SIGNING.
 *
 * At the prologue the player is asked for five people they could not have done
 * without, and what sex each of them is. Those names then come back — a
 * midwife in 1310, a rival's second son in 1688 — once each, and never again.
 *
 * It is the one place in the game where something outside the fiction is
 * carried into it, and the fiction is built to hold exactly that: the thing at
 * the table asked for names it could wear, and the family has spent a thousand
 * years not agreeing about why the same handful keeps turning up. The names
 * arrive with no fanfare and nothing points at them. A player who does not
 * notice has lost nothing; a player who does gets the only jolt this game can
 * deliver that no amount of authored prose can.
 *
 * ─── The rules, and why each one is where it is ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * ONCE EACH. `spentIn` is the year the name was handed out, and a name with a
 * year on it is never offered again. That is what makes the fifth arrival mean
 * something: the player learns, somewhere around the third, that the supply is
 * finite.
 *
 * SAME SEX. A friend's name goes on a person of the friend's sex, because the
 * point is recognition and this world's given names are strongly sexed.
 *
 * ONE TO A CENTURY. The bare coin paces them badly: a run produces about two
 * new people a year, so ten percent empties a five-name bag inside the first
 * century and the last nine hundred years never see one. `dealWindows` deals
 * each name a band of `FRIEND_SPAN_YEARS / n` and a random year inside it, and
 * a name is not in the bag until its year arrives. The coin is unchanged and
 * still decides WHO — it simply cannot reach a name that is not yet due.
 *
 * NO DICE WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO WIN. `claimFriendName` returns before it
 * touches the stream when no name of that sex is free — the user's "at least
 * while there are unused names of that gender available", and also the reason
 * a world nobody founded is bit-for-bit the world it was before this file
 * existed. The harness, the digest, every gate and every test bootstrap with
 * an empty roster and draw exactly the numbers they drew yesterday. Rolling
 * the coin first and discarding it would have been one line shorter and would
 * have moved every number in the game.
 *
 * SPENT IS SPENT, EVEN ON A CARD NOBODY TOOK. A suitor dealt to the Match and
 * declined has already had her name reserved (`rollRecipe`, and the comment
 * there says why). A friend's name spent that way is spent: the house heard it
 * once. The one exception is a newborn the player renames — see
 * `releaseFriendName`, and `renameChild`, which is the player saying no to the
 * suggestion rather than the world using the name up.

 * attribute is in it the day somebody adds the row — invariant 10's rule, which
 * is the whole reason this does not carry a list of six strings. Affinities are
 * left alone: those are what a person has read, and no name gets anybody into
 * the Library.
 *
 * DERIVED FROM A SEED, NOT STORED. The grants are a pure function of the
 * person's own seed, so `renameChild` can hand back exactly what it granted
 * without a second field on `Person` recording it — see the call in `sim.ts`.
