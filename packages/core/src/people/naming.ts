/**
 * WHO IS WORTH NAMING (issue #62).
 *
 * Measured through the client over five seeds, naming was **188.8 stops a
 * run — 37.1% of everything the player was ever asked**, and 205.6 names
 * typed. The single most frequent act in a game about deciding who marries
 * whom and what the book says was typing a name into a text field, for
 * people who mostly died unremarked. Naming is meant to be one of the four
 * verbs; it was the tax you paid to reach the other three.
 *
 * (It had already been cut once, from 686 to 189, by asking only for the
 * seat's children. That halved a form and left a form.)
 *
 * So the chronicler's suggestion is taken SILENTLY by default, and a prompt
 * is raised only where the child is somebody. `keepSuggestedNames` was
 * already a supported way to play; this makes it the default rather than a
 * 189-click opt-out.
 *
 * ── THE REASON IS PART OF THE PROMPT ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every surviving prompt says why it is being raised, in the family's own
 * terms. A prompt with no reason on it is indistinguishable from the form
 * this replaced — the player cannot tell a child who matters from the next
 * one in the queue, so they answer both the same way, which is the whole
 * failure being fixed.
 *
 * The reasons are checked in order and the FIRST one wins. A child who is
 * both the heir and a throwback is announced as the heir; a list of four
 * reasons reads as a database record rather than as a chronicler telling you
 * something.

 *
 * Now it does. A Head the player deliberately named after a man who held the

 * the house on a rising expectation, and carrying the name raises the bar he
 * is graded on. He does not start with an advantage and he cannot lose the

 *
 * ── WHY IT ONLY COUNTS A NAME THE PLAYER CHOSE ────────────────────────────

 * `dynasticNames` counts the dead, so the house produces an Edric the fourth
 * without anybody deciding anything. Grading every one of those would make
 * this a tax on the naming system rather than a consequence of a decision,
 * and it would move every number in the harness.
 *
 * So the test is the decision log. `renameChild` writes a `name` entry and
 * nothing else does — a chronicler-driven run has none, which is also why
 * `npm run digest` does not move.
