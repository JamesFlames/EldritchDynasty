/**
 * RIVAL-HOUSE DESCENT (issue #24 item 6).
 *
 * Every person's genome has always been materialized from their OWN house's
 * real `genePool` (`people/factory.ts`'s `materialize`), so a rival's
 * daughter already draws faithfully from her house's font and deleterious
 * frequencies. What this file adds is DESCENT: for the houses named below, a
 * new rival character is a child of a previously-materialized rival ancestor
 * through real `meiosis`, not an independent draw from a static frequency
 * table every time the Match deals a card.
 *
 * Deliberately shallow, per the issue's own scope guard: a genealogical
 * source for future brides, not six AI opponents. No rival docket, careers,
 * economy, chronicle or event loop — a `RivalPerson` carries only what
 * descent needs, and the only readers are `growRivalLineage` (which grows
 * it) and `people/minting.ts`'s `mintRecipe` (which spends her into the
 * player's world when a card built from her is taken).
 */

/**
 * WHICH HOUSES GROW ONE — issue #149 Stage 2.
 *
 * Stage 1 proved the shape with `house_marrow` alone. Stage 2 keeps the five
 * other named houses in the same shallow model and leaves the non-house pools
 * (`the_church`, `commons`, `the_marches`, `the_lag`, `the_fell`) as
 * fresh pool draws.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE THIS SWITCH WAS KEPT: the same eight seeds x 1,000 years on
 * the same GitHub Ubuntu runner class took 13.080s with Marrow alone and 17.396s
 * with all six — 1.33x, inside #149's ~2x ceiling. The existing 40-living
 * per-house soft cap therefore stays; reducing it without evidence would change the
 * genealogy this feature exists to model for no measured benefit.
