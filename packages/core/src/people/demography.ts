 * A SMALL LINE HAS NO BUFFER (issue #42, recalibrated issue #132).
 *
 * `broken_line` is one of §23's five endings. It fired in **0 of 60** runs
 * back when every newborn defaulted to `kind: 'blood'` regardless of
 * parentage (the bug #42's first commit, `436a8a7`, fixed) — the line was
 * inexhaustible, so nothing here was ever exercised against a real one. Once
 * blood became finite, `broken_line` fired in **33–39% of runs**, the median
 * one breaking **76 years after founding**, and it was a cliff: measured over
 * 60 seeds, **0 of 37 surviving runs ever passed through 1 or 2 living
 * blood** — a line either kept its founding few or went to zero, nothing in
 * between (issue #132).
 *
 * The mechanism below is not new; its CALIBRATION was stale by thirteen days.
 * It reacted to the house's own high-water mark, capped at
 * `MORTALITY_BUFFER_LINE` — so a house that peaked at four was measured
 * against four — and that graduated reading is exactly what let a founding
 * house's very first ordinary death engage real hazard: dropping from four
 * to three against a threshold of four is already a quarter short, squared
 * by the coefficient below into a real multiplier on the next death, and
 * every further loss compounded it before the house had a chance to grow
 * past its own tiny peak. A large family absorbs a bad year; a family of
 * four, thinned once, never got the chance to prove it wasn't ending.
 *
 * So the mechanism now asks a harder question first: has this house ever
 * actually reached the scale it is measured against? Below
 * `MORTALITY_BUFFER_LINE`, a house's current smallness IS its established
 * norm, not a decline from one — there is nothing yet to have fallen from.
 * The curve only engages once a house has proven it can hold the full
 * ten, which is also the population that supplied the ORIGINAL "one run in
 * twenty" reading this coefficient was swept against (`docs/BALANCE-LOG.md`,
 * "A line with nobody left to lose") — a mature house that grew past ten and
 * then crashes, typically under the Plague Age's own `mortalityMultiplier`.
 * That lever is untouched by this change.
 *
 * It reads the BLOOD, alive, for the same reason `livingBlood` and
 * `measureFortune` now do: a household full of servants is not a family, and
 * counting them made every reading of "is this line ending" impossible to
 * fail.
 *
 * It is not a rubber band (invariant 13). The Assize's arms react to how the
 * house is *doing* and announce themselves in the chronicle; this reacts to
 * one fact about the family and pushes only downward. The deaths it causes are
 * ordinary deaths and are chronicled as such, which is what #42 asks for: the
 * chain from decision to collapse has to be readable from the book alone.
 *
 * `broken_line` stays reachable — this does not remove the mechanism, only
 * the regime it was never actually tested against. Full measurement,

/**
 * A house is not a population. Left alone, every adult marrying and breeding
 * for twenty-seven years doubles the household every generation and the tree
 * becomes unreadable by year 1200. Two brakes, both deterministic:
 *
 *   COMPLETED FERTILITY  each couple has a target number of children, derived
 *                        from their inherited fecundity and their ids, so it is
 *                        stable across save and load.
 *   HOUSEHOLD PRESSURE   past a soft cap, births and marriages fall away. A
 *                        great house with sixty mouths and one seal is a house
 *                        with a succession problem, not a bigger house.
 *
 * Pressure is measured PER HALL, not per house. That is the whole demographic
 * consequence of cadet branches: the crowding brake used to be the only thing
 * standing between the family and forty people in one room, so it had to be
 * brutal, and the family stayed tiny for a thousand years as a result. Split
 * the roof and each hall has its own headroom — the house grows sideways,
 * which is how real ones did it.
 *
 * COMPLETED FERTILITY IS INHERITED. It was `2 + hash(seed, mother, father) % 4`
 * — stable across save and load, and inherited by nothing. Every marriage
 * decision in the game was a bet on WHAT a couple's children would be and never
 * on HOW MANY, so a house that married a famously fruitful line got precisely
 * nothing for it, and the only demographic dial we had was a constant the
 * player could not see. Three details worth keeping:
 *
 *   THE MOTHER CARRIES IT.  Seventy-thirty, not fifty-fifty. A man of a thin
 *   line is a mild disappointment; a woman of one is the whole marriage. This
 *   is what puts fertility into the same economy as the font — you are reading
 *   a bride's mother and her sisters for two different things at once — and it
 *   is why a daughter married outward costs the house twice. The ratio lives in
 *   `people/vitality.ts` and is used twice: as a weight on the inherited cap
 *   here, and as an exponent on the pair's fertility there. One rule about
 *   whose fertility it mostly is, not two constants that drift.
 *
 *   CENTRED, NOT HARDCODED.  The mapping is relative to the attribute's
 *   population mean, computed from the locus table at bootstrap. Retune
 *   `LOCI_PER_CORE` and family sizes stay where they are instead of drifting.
 *
 *   STILL JITTERED.  A couple keeps a small id-derived wobble, so two
 *   brothers who married two sisters do not complete identical families.
 */

/**
 * A CEILING IS NOT ENOUGH, which the first cut of this got wrong.
 *
 * Completed fertility is a cap on a couple's children, and measured over four
 * hundred years most couples never reach theirs — crowding, a husband dead at
 * fifty, and a 16% annual chance get there first. So making the cap heritable
 * changed almost nothing about who actually had children: the top third of
 * mothers by fecundity bore very slightly FEWER than the bottom third, which
 * is noise, which is the same as saying the attribute was decorative.
 *
 * Fecundity therefore drives the annual chance as well. That is also what the
 * word means: not how many you may have, but how readily they come.
 *
 * It drives it through FERTILITY now rather than directly — the same inherited
 * number, read through the body carrying it. See `people/vitality.ts`. The
 * constant below is what a REFERENCE couple gets: mean fecundity, sound health,
 * both at the peak of their curves. Everyone else is a fraction of it, and that
 * fraction is why this number is higher than the flat 0.16 it replaced without
 * the house being any larger — a curve averaging about seven tenths over a
 * fertile lifetime has to be paid for at the peak.
 *
 * TUNED AGAINST THE TREASURY, not the household. Twenty seeds to 2042: the
 * house lands at 66 living against 64 before the change, which is noise, and
 * the two numbers downstream of it are not. A house one child larger per
 * generation is a house that spends its surplus on kin upkeep, stops being able
 * to keep an archivist, and stops recovering the Ledger — 0.23 cost eight
 * points of staffed years and a clause per run, all of it invisible from the
 * demography. Anyone retuning this measures `years with staff` and `clauses
 * recovered`, not just how many Gearithys are standing in 2042.
