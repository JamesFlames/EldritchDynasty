/**
 * THE PAPERS — what a dowry actually is (concept §7, world §13).
 *
 * §7 states it flatly and the engine did not model it at all: *"A dowry is not
 * money. Great houses negotiate in lineage documentation: three generations of
 * maternal records, notarised. Forging them is an industry."* World §13 says
 * the same from the other side — *"Coin and land come with it, but the papers
 * are the negotiation."*
 *
 * The Match priced the coin beautifully and asked for no papers, so the half
 * of a marriage negotiation that §7 calls the whole of it was missing. The
 * consequence was not a missing feature so much as a missing SQUEEZE: a house
 * in 1042 has no maternal record because it has no dead women yet, and there
 * was nothing anywhere in the game that a young house could not buy its way
 * past with coin it did not have to spend on anything else.
 *
 * Three things live here.
 *
 *   WHAT THE HOUSE CAN SHOW.  `maternalDepth` walks `claimedParents.mother`,
 *                             the RECORD and not the blood, exactly as
 *                             `matchF` and `pedigreeF` do. A house's papers
 *                             are its own written memory of its women.
 *
 *   WHAT A MATCH DEMANDS.     `papersDemanded`. A great house wants the full
 *                             three generations; a farm asks for nothing.
 *
 *   WHAT A FORGERY IS.        `forge_lineage` already points a claimed mother
 *                             at somebody else's grandmother, which raises
 *                             `maternalDepth` on its own — the mechanism was
 *                             always there and nothing read it. What is added
 *                             here is the part that makes it a bet: a filed
 *                             forgery can be CAUGHT, on world §16's own terms.
 *
 * `Person.lineageDocuments` was written by `forge_lineage` and read by nothing
 * (invariant 11). This is its reader.

/**
 * What this match asks the house to produce, in generations.
 *
 * A negotiation is between two houses and the papers run both ways, but only
 * one side of it is a decision the player makes — so what is modelled is what
 * the OTHER house asks of this one. It scales with what the card is worth for
 * the same reason the coin does: nobody asks a quarry family for a notarised
 * pedigree, and House Marrow will not open the conversation without one.
 *
 * A cousin asks for nothing. That is not a discount, it is the definition:
 * both sides are reading the same book, and there is nothing to prove to
 * somebody whose grandmother is also yours. It is also the third distinct
 * thing the free card is buying, alongside the coin and the concentrated
 * blood, and the first one that bites in the century when the house is young.
 *
 * THE TIERS FOLLOW THE HOUSE BEFORE THEY FOLLOW THE PRICE, and that is world
 * §13's wording rather than a balance choice: *"GREAT HOUSES negotiate in
 * lineage documentation."* A quarry family at Hesk asking a notarised
 * three-generation pedigree for a twenty-crown groom is not this world. The
 * first draft asked one generation at the commonest tier, which put a paper
 * demand on nearly every card in the game and closed the whole outsider market
 * against the founding cast — who have no recorded mothers, because nobody in
 * 1042 has a dead one yet. `deepBlood` is the axis that means "a house whose
 * name is worth something", and the coin thresholds now sit above the tier
 * every ordinary card is dealt at.
