/**
 * INVARIANT `canHoldPost` (schema) is the only placement gate; this is the
 * refusal a client can read, shaped like `canStudySpellbook`'s.
 *
 * Every post in the game is a man's — §18's careers are real institutions and
 * every one of them is closed to a woman in Aubren: a commission in the Warden's levy, ordination
 * at the Bramme chapter house, a place in the King's household, a share in a
 * Sarrow venture, a bench at Cawdry, a bed at the Colleges.
 *
 * Three doors write `Person.career` — the player's `career` order, the
 * steward's `placePosts`, and the authored `career` effect — and before this
 * function each of them asked only for an age. So the steward bought
 * commissions for daughters, the table offered them, and the events narrated
 * them in prose that had already decided otherwise: "ordination is not a post
 * a man leaves", "He is very good at it", "Two sons, and one place". A woman
 * held the family's clergy cover and was out of the breeding pool for it.
 *
 * The gate is one function rather than a clamp at each of the three, for the reason
 * invariant 1 gives about Madness: a clamp is a thing a fourth door bypasses
 * by accident. A woman's exclusion from the posts is not her exclusion from
 * the game — the tutor's term, the library, the Match and the Record are all
 * hers, and the Threshold four are hers to practise (invariant 4).
