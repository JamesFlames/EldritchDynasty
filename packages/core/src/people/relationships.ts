/**
 * RELATIONSHIPS AND GRUDGES.
 *
 * "Enemies are not a type. Hostility is an edge" — `schema/src/house.ts` said
 * so, defined `Relationship` and `Grudge` with an `inheritance` enum, and
 * nothing anywhere read either of them. Four authored outcomes emitted
 * `kind: relationship` effects, including the seal feud's own grudge —
 * severity 60, `inheritance: all_blood` — and every one of them evaporated at
 * the point of application. The effect switch listed the case with a comment
 * saying it was handled by its own subsystem. There was no subsystem.
 *
 * The point of the enum is that a grudge OUTLIVES the man who took it. A feud
 * whose parties are both dead by the second generation is not a feud, it is an
 * argument — so the same fall-through the arc bindings use applies here: his
 * heir, then his closest blood, then his house. Only a vanished house ends it.
