/**
 * THE BOND — how this world holds a person who would rather go (world §12).
 *
 * The design says what this may and may not be, and it is worth quoting
 * because it is the whole specification:
 *
 *   *"Nobody in this world is a slave and there is no serfdom in Aubren.
 *   People are held by debt, custom, contract and having nowhere else to go,
 *   which is sufficient."*
 *
 * So there is no chattel tier here and there will not be one. What there is is
 * DEBT, and debt is sufficient: a bonded servant cannot leave for arrears,
 * cannot leave when the house is destitute, and is not released by the death
 * of the man who signed them. Everything an unfree tier does mechanically,
 * done by the one instrument the world actually has.
 *
 * `term: 'bonded'` has been in `RetainerContractS` since its first draft and
 * meant nothing: `releaseContracts` tested `seasonal`, `yearly` and
 * `hereditary` by name and a bonded contract fell through every branch as
 * though it were `lifetime`. It had no sum attached, so there was nothing for
 * it to be a bond ABOUT. `RetainerContract.debt` is that sum and this file is
 * what reads it.
 *
 * THE PRICE OF CHEAP HANDS. A bonded servant is not paid — the wage services
 * the debt instead — so `driftLoyalty` cannot buy their silence, and a bond
 * long enough to be worth taking is long enough to end in somebody who knows
 * things and is owed nothing. That is not a balance penalty bolted on. It is
 * the same trade the rest of this game makes: the cheap option is cheap now
 * and is charged for later, by a system that was already running.
 *
 * Units are MARKS, because `RetainerContract.wage` is marks a year (world §11)
 * and a debt that a wage pays down has to be in the wage's own money. The
 * treasury is in crowns; `CROWN` is the conversion and it is world §13's.

 * a year this is a little over thirty years of service, which is long, hard,
 * and finite — and the servant who works it off walks out knowing everything.

 * The debt is forgiven and the bond ends.
 *
 * Distinct from being released, and that distinction is the point of the
 * `freed` branch of `onEmployerDeath`, which until now did exactly what
 * `released` did. A freed servant leaves owing nothing and does not carry the
 * grievance that drives a secret out of the house — see `walkSecrets`, whose
 * `ReleaseReason` decides how bitter the leaving was.
 *
 * ─── What it costs, and what it buys ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * AGAINST.  The debt is written off, and the sum is an asset. They go onto
 *           `yearly` terms, which means they draw a wage the house has not
 *           been paying and `releaseContracts` can let them go the next lean
 *           quarter — a captive who could not leave becomes an employee who
 *           can. And every other bondsman in the house loses
 *           `RESENTMENT_OF_FREEDOM`, because it was done for him and not for
 *           them.
 *
 * FOR.      The freed man's loyalty jumps by `FREEDOM_LOYALTY`, which is the
 *           whole of the defence in `leakChance`. A bond runs the other way —
 *           `LOYALTY_BONDED` bleeds him a little every year — so the house
 *           that holds a man for thirty years and then lets him go has bought
 *           itself somebody who knows where everything is and owes it nothing.
 *           Freeing him is how that is not what happens.
 *
 * So the two ways out of a bond are: work it off, and end up with a bitter man
 * who knows things; or tear it up, and pay for a loyal one in coin and in the
 * temper of everybody still held. Neither is the safe answer, which is the
 * shape every decision in this game is supposed to have.
