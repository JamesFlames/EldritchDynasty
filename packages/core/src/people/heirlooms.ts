/**
 * APPLYING AN HEIRLOOM TO A PERSON — one mechanism, for every heirloom there
 * will ever be.
 *
 * An heirloom declares who it may be used on (the `Filter` vocabulary slots
 * use) and what it does (the closed `Effect` union events use). Nothing here
 * knows what any particular heirloom IS. Adding one is a YAML edit, which is
 * the same bargain the rest of the pipeline makes: content open, verbs closed.
 *
 * The bearer is bound to the token `BEARER`, so an heirloom addresses its
 * target exactly the way an event addresses a cast member — which means the
 * same effect list works in both places and there is one targeting model to
 * learn rather than two.
 *
 * What differs between heirlooms is what using one COSTS it, and that is the
 * `spends` flag: consumed, cooldown, or reusable. See `schema/heirloom.ts`.
