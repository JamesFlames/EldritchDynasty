/**
 * Names are load-bearing in this world (concept §3). They are plain, slightly
 * archaic, and deliberately not fantasy-inflected — age is carried by content,
 * not by apostrophes.
 *
 * THE FAILURE THIS MODULE SHIPPED WITH. There were 24 given names per sex, a
 * run mints about eleven hundred people, and the only disambiguator was an
 * ordinal that stopped at the ninth. Everyone after that got
 * `${base} ${rng.int(999)}`. Measured across three thousand-year runs: the
 * first numeric name was born in 1153 — year 111 of 1,000 — and SIXTY-EIGHT
 * PERCENT of every person in the run was called something like `Garrick 788`.
 * Between 34 and 43 people out of eleven hundred had a plain name. The marriage
 * market, which is the most-read screen in the game, was dealing three cards a
 * hand reading `Wystan 507`, `Quenton 879`, `Nevin 573`.
 *
 * Nothing threw. Every test passed. This is the codebase's own failure mode
 * (`CLAUDE.md`, "fails by doing nothing") wearing its plainest costume.
 *
 * Three things fix it, and they are different fixes for different people:
 *
 *   RETIREMENT.  A name is spoken for while its holder lives and for a
 *                generation after. Then it comes back. `retireNames` in
 *                `sim.ts` does this, and it is what keeps the pool from ever
 *                draining: the working set is the living, not the dead.
 *
 *   BYNAMES.     Outside the house, a repeat is disambiguated the way a real
 *                village does it — by where you are from or what you are
 *                known for. `Garrick of Hesk`. `Garrick the lame`.
 *
 *   ORDINALS.    Inside the house, a repeat is DYNASTIC and the ordinal counts
 *                every holder ever, living or dead. `Edric the fourth` is a
 *                claim about three men before him, which is the whole point of
 *                naming a boy Edric. See `NameOrigin.borne`.
 *
 * The numeric branch is gone. `uniqueName` cannot return a digit.
