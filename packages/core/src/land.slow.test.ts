/**
 * ISSUE #94's ACCEPTANCE BAR, played rather than asserted in the abstract: a
 * run that is actually driven — buying when it can, selling down a glut —
 * both buys and sells over its life, is refused for want of coin often
 * enough that the refusal means something, and the auction still lands at
 * least one book once land is in the game too. §13's whole design bet is
 * that all three compete for one treasury; this is the proof they still can.
 *
 * `playLand` is a POLICY, not an AI: buy every affordable lot, sell down the
 * smallest glut of farms once the house is holding a lot of them. It is
 * chosen to exercise both verbs without needing either to look clever, the
 * same way `economy.slow.test.ts` drives its own batches by a rule rather
 * than by picking what looks good.
