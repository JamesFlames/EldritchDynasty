/**
 * THE REGALIA, OVER REAL RUNS.
 *
 * Three objects that `story/Age-1.md` fixes, that Demigod requires held at
 * once, that `seal_the_regalia_incomplete` has the Church count, and that no
 * run of this game owned until `houses.yaml` was given somewhere to say so.
 *
 * The failure this file exists for is not a crash. `useHeirloom` checks the
 * heirloom's own `target` filters against whoever it is handed, and when they
 * do not pass it applies nothing, changes nothing and reports nothing — so an
 * event whose slot is looser than the object it hands out fires, reads
 * correctly, writes its chronicle line, and does not happen. The ring shipped
 * that way twice in one afternoon: `mind >= 62`, then `42`, against a
 * population whose expected `mind` is 30.4. Both times the arc fired in a
 * quarter of runs and the ring went onto exactly one hand in twenty-four.

 * scenes the tier's typography and folklore rules were written for. An arc
 * node is forced: `selection.ts` keeps it out of the ambient and pressure
 * pools, so nothing ever asks the cooldown about it before it fires.
 *
 * It used to spend the ration anyway, which meant every rare climax of every
 * substory barred every ambient rare event in the game for fifty-five years.
 * Adding four substories to this drop measurably pushed the Drowning's rarest
 * ending off the board, and the only visible symptom was an outcome-reach gate
 * naming a different casualty after every content change.
