 * NAMING IS A REWARD, NOT A FORM (issue #62).

 * Measured through the client over five seeds, naming was 188.8 stops a run —
 * **37.1% of everything the player was ever asked** — and the single most
 * frequent act in the game was typing a name into a text field for somebody
 * who died unremarked. It is now 23.8, and every survivor carries a reason.
 *
 * These assert the RULES rather than the rate: the rate is one measurement in
 * `naming-worth.slow.test.ts`, and a rule that can never fire is invisible in
 * it either way. That is not hypothetical here — #62 asks for a twin rule and
 * this simulation cannot bear twins, which the rate would never have said.
