/**
 * WOMEN AWAKEN, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN (issue #78).
 *
 * `rollAwakening` gates on `carriedFont`, not `canExpress`, so roughly six
 * awakenings in ten in this game happen to women. That ratio was filed as a
 * suspected invariant-4 violation and it is not one: §11 asks for it in as
 * many words — *"In daughters, Awakening is timed by what they carry rather
 * than by what they can use"* — because an early-waking girl is the only
 * unfakeable signal in a marriage market otherwise built on forged papers.
 *
 * The reason this is a test and not a comment is that the ratio LOOKS like the
 * bug every time somebody meets it, and the fix that suggests itself — narrow
 * the gate to `canExpress` — is one word, passes typecheck, passes the whole
 * existing suite, and silently deletes a designed mechanic that nothing else
 * measures. So it fails the build instead.
 *
 * The second half is the containment: the ratio is only safe because an
 * awakened woman gains nothing she can express and nothing she can overflow.
 * The suite above proves that of every incapable person; this proves it of
 * the awakened ones specifically, which is the population the fear is about.
