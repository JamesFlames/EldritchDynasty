 * THE FAÇADE, DRIVEN THE WAY A CLIENT DRIVES IT.
 *
 * The simulation underneath is well covered. The API over it was not: one
 * function in five on `GameSession` had never been called by anything, and the
 * gaps were not scattered — they were the verbs a UI needs and the harness's
 * own diagnostics. `declineHand` is a real move a player can make. `hallOf`,
 * `branchReport` and `frequencyReport` are what the editor's Instruments tab
 * reads. `describeDecision` is what the harness prints when it is bisecting a
 * run, which is to say the thing you reach for when something is already
 * wrong — the worst possible moment to find out it throws.
 *
 * This drives a short game through the public surface and asserts each verb
 * returns something coherent. It is deliberately not a balance test: it does
 * not care what happens, only that asking produces an answer.
