 * MEIOTIC DRIVE, AND WHY THE X HAS ONE (issue #41).
 *
 * A son's font comes only from his mother, and on a fair coin a mother with
 * one hot X and one cold one hands over an even mosaic of the two. Measured
 * over three thousand-year runs before this existed: the founding haplotype
 * halves every generation, the deepest blood in the house falls from 31 to 4
 * inside four generations, and from there the family is carried by mutation
 * rather than by inheritance. Every strategy the game offers — the Match, the
 * standing order, withholding a daughter — was measured against that decay and
 * none of them touched it, because none of them can: they choose WHO marries,
 * and the loss happens inside the meiosis afterwards.
 *
 * So the blood is not transmitted fairly. The haplotype carrying more font is
 * the one a female meiosis is likelier to start from, at the rate the font
 * loci themselves declare (`LocusDef.drive`). It is invisible, it is never
 * certain, and it changes nothing about whether a given X does anything —
 * which is what keeps invariant 4 intact: a gift that is likelier to be handed
 * on is not a gift that can be scheduled.
 *
 * Returned as a probability that the walk starts on haplotype 0, so a locus
 * table with no drive authored anywhere returns exactly 0.5 and the whole
 * mechanism is a fair coin again.
