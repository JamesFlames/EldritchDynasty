/**
 * THE ASSIZE — the world's opinion of how the house is doing, and what it does
 * about it.
 *
 * Measured across fourteen thousand-year runs, the shipped game could not be
 * lost and could not be won differently: zero houses died out, the household
 * never fell below ten people, every player-driven run finished with nine of
 * nine Ledger clauses, and standing landed on exalted or eminent nearly every
 * time. Five endings are authored (§23) and the simulation could not tell them
 * apart, because every run arrived at the same place.
 *
 * The cause is not any one number. It is that NOTHING IN THE WORLD REACTS TO
 * THE HOUSE. A family at eight hundred crowns and a family at twenty-two
 * thousand were living in the same indifferent country, so the run had no
 * feedback of either sign — no compounding failure to fear, and no resistance
 * to push against once things were going well.
 *
 * So the world watches, and it answers. Two arms, and both are visible:
 *
 *   THE WORLD RESENTS YOU.   A house that is plainly doing well is assessed,
 *                            courted away from, informed on, asked for a ward,
 *                            and charged more for everything. None of it is
 *                            fatal and all of it is annoying, which is exactly
 *                            what success is supposed to feel like from
 *                            underneath.
 *
 *   THE WORLD STEADIES YOU.  A house that is visibly failing is a problem for
 *                            everyone around it. The Church would rather feed
 *                            you than have a hall full of desperate people
 *                            eighteen miles from its chapter house. Charity is
 *                            not kindness here; it is somebody else's stability
 *                            being bought.
 *
 * WHY IT IS EXPLICIT. A hidden rubber band that quietly nudges the dice is a
 * lie the player can feel and cannot name, and it makes every good outcome
 * suspect. Every response here writes a line into the chronicle saying who did
 * what and why. The player is meant to read "House Marrow will not bid against
 * Calder while your name is on the lot" and understand that this is what being
 * ahead costs.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. It never touches the genetics, never touches Madness, never
 * makes Eldritch Power more reliable, and never reaches into an authored
 * outcome. It moves money, standing, loyalty, grievance and mortality — the
 * things a country can actually do to a family.
