/**
 * WHICH LANE A SUITE IS IN, ENFORCED RATHER THAN ASKED FOR.
 *
 * `vitest.config.ts` has said "a new suite that runs a century takes the
 * `.slow` suffix" since the two lanes were split. Nothing checked it, and
 * SEVEN suites did not: ascension, relationships, table, session-api, assize,
 * session and attention between them turned the fix-and-rerun loop from the
 * documented three seconds into a hundred, with `ascension.test.ts` alone
 * running twenty-four thousand-year games inside it.
 *
 * Nothing about that was visible. Every one of those suites passed, every
 * time; the only symptom was a loop nobody wanted to run, and three documents
 * quoting a number that had been wrong for months.
 *
 * So the rule is a test now. It is deliberately STRUCTURAL rather than a
 * stopwatch: a timing assertion in CI fails on a noisy machine and gets
 * muted, and the thing worth guarding is not a particular second count but
 * the reason for it — a suite that simulates centuries is not a loop.
 *
 * If a suite needs a millennium, it does not need an exemption. It needs the
 * suffix, and it keeps every assertion it had when it moves. Where the line
 * sits, and why it is drawn at whole games rather than at a year count, is on
 * `MILLENNIUM` below.

 * `newGame`, no `advance`, no `runYears` anywhere in the file — and 61.1
 * seconds, 41% of the entire fast lane, because the runs happen INSIDE the
 * gate functions it calls. The rule was enforced and the lane was still

 * of this file. So the rule is DECLARATION rather than duration: a fast-lane
 * suite may drive a batch through somebody else's entry point, but it has to
 * say so here, with what it drives. A file that quietly starts playing
 * millennia through a gate fails this until a person writes down the cost —
 * and writing it down is where somebody asks whether it belongs in the loop.
 *
 * WHICH MODULES COUNT IS NOT A LIST ANYBODY MAINTAINS, same as everywhere
 * else in this file: a module under `tools/` (or `harness.ts`) that contains
 * `bootstrap`, `runYears`, `newGame` or `TEST_FAMILIES` exists to drive
 * batches, and importing from one is what gets declared. File-level on
 * purpose — an earlier cut of this resolved individual function names and

/**
 * ── AND WHICH SHARD A SUITE IS IN ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything above is about the two LANES — fast and slow, decided by a
 * filename. This is the other half of the same failure, one level down.
 *
 * Run 185 (`main`, green, 4601428): `test 2/4` took 67m47s while the other
 * three shards took 3m02s, 10m45s and 4m03s. Every job in that build started
 * within three seconds of every other, so nothing was queuing — one shard held
 * a 68-minute build open while seven jobs sat finished and idle. Total test
 * work was 85m37s; balanced, that is about 21 minutes a shard, and the build
 * floor becomes the `batch` gate lane. Forty-six minutes a build, and no test
 * deleted.
 *
 * NOTHING REPORTED IT, and that is the part this file is for. Vitest shards by
 * a hash of the file PATH, so which suites a shard draws is re-rolled every
 * time a test file is added anywhere in the repository. Every shard was green.
 * `check.yml` carried a paragraph arguing that balancing them would buy
 * nothing, which had been true at run 125 and was three times out by run 185.
 * A timing comment cannot notice that it has stopped being true.
 *
 * So the packing is data now (`tools/test-durations.json`, written by
 * `npm run cost -- --full --write`), the sequencer reads it
 * (`tools/shards.mjs`), and this is the rule that fails when it drifts. The
 * same argument as `DRIVES_A_BATCH` above: not a stopwatch, which would fail
 * on a noisy runner and be muted within a fortnight, but a claim about
 * COMMITTED DATA, which is free to check and cannot be noisy.

 * total/n — whenever no single FILE costs more than a shard's fair share.
 * 1.5 is that 1.33 with a little room for the fact that the durations are a
 * measurement and not a constant.
 *
 * So this number is not really a tolerance for bad packing. It is a detector
 * for THE ONE THING PACKING CANNOT FIX: vitest parallelises per file, so a
 * file bigger than total/n is a floor no packing and no shard count gets
 * under, and it is the only way a spread above 4/3 can happen. When this
 * fails, the fix is never to raise it — it is in AGENTS.md, with its one
 * prohibition: split the file BY TEST, never by seed range.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-20, after #143: spread 1.00x, four shards of about eleven
 * minutes, the longest file (`arcs.slow.test.ts`, 10.6 min) just inside a
 * shard's fair share of 10.9. Before it: 4.12x, one shard of sixty minutes
 * holding a 68-minute build open while three finished in fifteen and idled.

 * about eleven minutes is well under one per cent — invisible to the balance
 * either way. It is also about as many test files as land between two
 * measurements in practice, so adding a suite does not force a fifteen-minute
