   * honest measurements. Neither meant what the test's name says.
   *
   * Naming was 37% of the budget, and naming was a form — 189 prompts a run
   * for children who mostly died unremarked. It was padding the denominator.
   * Take it out, as #62 does, and `choice` reads 75.3% across this batch
   * without a single extra choice event firing: the counts here are 280-308,
   * where the pre-cut measurement was 285.8.
   *
   * So `choice` has always been about four-fifths of the DECISIONS in this
   * game, and the assertion that no kind owned the run passed only because a
   * form was standing in the way of noticing. That is worth knowing and it is
   * not a regression, so this no longer pretends a 58% ceiling is meaningful.
   *
   * WHAT IS GUARDED NOW, and both are measured over these six seeds:
   *
   *   `choice` at 75.3% mean and 79.5% worst seat. A batch past 82% is a
   *   choice tide rising against everything else, which is the regression
   *   this can actually catch.
   *
   *   `name` under a tenth of the budget. That is #62's rule expressed as a
   *   share rather than a count, and it is the one that would silently come
   *   undone: a new prompt reason that fires for every child restores the
   *   form without changing a single number anybody looks at.
   *
   * That choice IS three-quarters of what a player does is a real finding and
   * a live question for #65 and #66, not something this file should bless.

  /**
   * ── THE DENSITY, AND THE ANSWER TO #88 ────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * #88 asks whether ~300 choice events in a 1,000-year run was the intended
   * density or an artefact of every phase being allowed to present. It names
   * one dial — `EVENT_BUDGET_PER_YEAR = 0.35` in `year/phases.ts`, spent once
   * a year in the `ambient` phase — and three possible answers: (1) it is
   * right, (2) fewer draws, (3) same draws, differently distributed.
   *
   * THE ANSWER IS (1), AND THE MEASUREMENT IS WHY. Run over these 25 seeds at
   * both shipped terms on 2026-09-20 (`npm run gate:density -- --seeds=…`):
   *
   *   term  gens  choice  per gen    per age  repeat run  repeat age  ordinary
   *   500   17.6  126     7.2 ±0.2   15.3     27%         3%          31.0
   *   300   10.9   77     7.1 ±0.3   17.0     21%         3%          27.6
   *
   * SEVEN AND A TWO-TENTHS CHOICES A GENERATION, AND THE SAME NUMBER IN BOTH
   * CAMPAIGNS. That is the finding. #133 cut the Long Line from 1,000 years
   * to 500 and #66 will add a 300-year Short Line, and the per-generation
   * figure does not move between them — 7.2 against 7.1, inside each other's
   * error bars. A density that is invariant across a 40% change of term is a
   * property of the design rather than of the term, which is exactly what the
   * revised acceptance asked to be measured instead of inferred by halving.
   *
   * AND THE REPETITION HALF OF THE COMPLAINT IS PAID. The complaint underneath
   * #88 was never really the count — 300 draws over a pool of 454 is #86's
   * rota and #85's flat century arriving from a third direction. #86's rota is
   * closed and #65's chaptering has landed, and neither had been re-measured.
   * They worked: **3% of choice presentations repeat a template inside the same
   * Age**, at both terms. Within a whole run it is 27% over 500 years, which is
   * a run seeing 90 distinct templates — a re-meeting after decades, not a
   * treadmill. Lowering the budget would have made a thin game shorter.
   *
   * THE ONE THING WORTH WATCHING is the ordinary span: 31 years is the longest
   * stretch a 500-year run goes with no Match, no Record block and no Age
   * boundary — about 7% of a run presenting nothing but ambient panels. That
   * is a distribution figure and it belongs to #65's chaptering, not to this
   * dial. Recorded in `docs/BALANCE-LOG.md`; not guarded here, because nothing
   * has established what the right number for it is.
   *
   * WHY A BAND AND NOT A CEILING. A ceiling catches a tide rising and cannot
   * catch one falling, and falling is precisely what happens the moment
   * somebody takes answer (2) — the count drops, every share assertion in this
   * file stays green because the shares are unchanged, and the game quietly
   * gets thinner. So both ends, and both terms.
   *
   * 5.5 and 9.5 are ±25% of the measured 7.2, which catches the dial being
   * moved by a quarter in either direction and clears two standard errors by
   * an order of magnitude (se is 0.10 at 500 years, 0.15 at 300). A tighter
   * band would be measuring the draw; a looser one would not notice 0.35
   * becoming 0.25.
