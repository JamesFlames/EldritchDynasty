/**
 * THE TABLE — the half of the game the player was never allowed to play.
 *
 * Every verb on `GameSession` answered a prompt the simulation raised. There
 * was no verb a player could use on a turn of their own choosing, and the
 * `auction`, `careers` and `library` phases docketed nothing at all — they
 * ticked, correctly, forever, and the player watched.
 *
 * That quietly deleted the concept's own headline tension. §13: *"special
 * education competes directly with the auction. Tutor the child you have, or
 * buy the book his grandchildren might read. Both are correct; you can afford
 * one."* The player made neither decision. And §14's auction — "announced
 * years ahead so the player can liquidate, borrow, or start planning something
 * regrettable" — resolved itself.
 *
 * The cost of that was not only agency. It was the ladder. Measured over six
 * thousand-year runs before this file existed, the most books any member of
 * the house ever finished was ONE, because `beginStudy` was reachable only
 * from an authored `study` effect and there are a handful of those in a
 * hundred and twenty-four templates, while every rung above Touched wants
 * reading (`booksFor`). The Ascension Ladder was not merely ungated — it was
 * starved four systems upstream, exactly the way both frame interludes were
 * (`CLAUDE.md`: "measure the whole funnel before moving anything").
 *
 * ─── What a table order is ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A standing order, not an action. The player says what the house is to do
 * with its people and its money, the year phases carry it out, and the order
 * stands until it is finished or withdrawn. That is what a head of house
 * actually does — nobody micromanages a decade — and it means the table costs
 * the player a handful of decisions a generation rather than a stream of them.
 *
 * ─── The steward ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `runStandingOrders` also acts when the player has NOT spoken, and that is
 * deliberate. A house whose player never opens the table still reads its books
 * and fills its posts, because a house does. The steward is a floor, not a
 * strategy: he puts idle readers on the cheapest book they can learn and
 * leaves the money alone. Everything above that floor is the player's, and the
 * difference between the floor and a played table is the whole point.
