/**
 * THE OTHER AGENT'S HALF OF THE HARNESS.
 *
 * AGENTS.md says this repository is supported under both Claude Code and
 * Codex and that all four platform/agent combinations are first-class. That
 * was prose, and everything it claimed about the Codex half was false:
 *
 *  - `.codex/hooks.json` named `C:\Users\GGPC\Documents\repos\...`. An
 *    absolute path on one developer's machine registers nothing on any other,
 *    and nothing at all on Linux.
 *  - The script it named was a COPY of the Claude one, gated on
 *    `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE = true`. Codex sets no environment variables of its
 *    own, so that copy exited at line one of every session it ran in — no
 *    install, no cache warm, and no orientation, which is the step that
 *    unshallows the clone and is the difference between git answering
 *    ancestry questions and git answering them WRONGLY.
 *  - `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse` were not registered for Codex at all, so
 *    the generated-file guard — the enforcement half of two rules in the "Do
 *    not" list — did not exist there.
 *  - And the "Do not" list itself did not reach Codex either: see the budget
 *    test at the bottom.
 *
 * Every one of those is silent. A session under Codex looked exactly like a
 * session with a working harness, which is this codebase's signature failure
 * mode showing up inside its own enforcement.
