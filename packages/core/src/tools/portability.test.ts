/**
 * BOTH PLATFORMS, ENFORCED RATHER THAN ASKED FOR.
 *
 * AGENTS.md has a section called "Supported environments" saying this
 * repository works on Windows and Linux, under Claude Code and Codex, and that
 * all four combinations are first-class. It was prose, and for months it was
 * false in the one place an agent could not see it:
 *
 *   - Every hook was `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, and two of them piped stdin
 *     through `jq` to read their own payload. Neither bash nor jq is on a
 *     Windows box by default, and neither is on a CI runner unless somebody
 *     put it there.
 *   - `.codex/hooks.json` named `C:\Users\GGPC\Documents\repos\...` — one
 *     particular machine, resolvable by no other checkout on any platform —
 *     and the script it pointed at exited early unless `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE`
 *     was set, which Codex never sets.
 *   - `tools/janitor.sh` used bash 4 associative arrays and process
 *     substitution, so the one command in this repository that DELETES things
 *     could only be rehearsed from a Linux box.
 *   - Every job in `check.yml` ran on `ubuntu-latest`, so none of that was
 *     ever exercised anywhere it would fail.
 *
 * NOT ONE OF THOSE THROWS. A session hook that cannot start prints nothing an
 * agent sees: the clone stays shallow, `merge-base --is-ancestor` then answers
 * FALSE past the graft boundary rather than failing, so every "has this
 * landed" reads wrong in the direction that looks cautious, and the claims
 * other sessions hold are simply not printed. A Windows agent got a worse
 * session than a Linux one and had no way to find out. That is this codebase's
 * signature failure mode wearing a shell script, and docs/FAILURES.md is full
 * of the same shape.
 *
 * So the rule is a test, and it runs in the fast lane on BOTH runners.
