/**
 * IS THE RUN LOSABLE? THE ENDING DISTRIBUTION (issue #42).
 *
 *   npm run gate:endings -- [runs] [years]
 *   npm run gate:endings -- 250 500
 *
 * `assize.ts` has carried the finding this exists to close since it shipped:
 *
 *   > Measured across fourteen thousand-year runs, the shipped game could not
 *   > be lost and could not be won differently: zero houses died out, the
 *   > household never fell below ten people, every player-driven run finished
 *   > with nine of nine Ledger clauses, and standing landed on exalted or
 *   > eminent nearly every time. Five endings are authored (§23) and the
 *   > simulation could not tell them apart.
 *
 * ─── The target, and where it came from ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Recorded on the issue before this file existed, so the gate is written
 * against a decision rather than fitted to whatever the batch produced:
 * **about one run in three ends in a loss the player feels as one.** The harsh
 * end of the genre, chosen over "rare and memorable" on the grounds that a
 * collapse one house in ten suffers is a story about luck.
 *
 * Four of the five endings are losses of different kinds and they do not all
 * feel like one, so the target is read over the three CATASTROPHES —
 * `unmade`, `broken_line`, `devoured` — and `forgotten` is held to its own
 * floor. The reason for splitting it out is §29's own acceptance clause (*the
 * Forgotten stays reachable*: the modest house has to lose too, and
 * differently), which a gate that pooled them could not see.
 *
 * ─── The judgement is split from the playing ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * `verdictOver` is a function over runs, so `ending-gate.test.ts` can hand it
 * a distribution where the run is losable and one where every house arrives
 * at the same place — which is the state this issue was filed about, and the
 * one thing a gate over the real bundle can never demonstrate it would catch.
 *
 * ─── It IS in `npm run gate` ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Registered in `GATES` (`tools/gates.ts`) and pinned there by
 * `gates.test.ts`. An earlier draft of this comment said otherwise — written
 * before `endings` was added to the registry and never updated once it was.
 * `gate:endings -- 250 500` is how to run it standalone with a bigger
 * batch than CI's default carries.
 *
 * ─── The second column: `ascendant` (issue #61, Stage D) ───────────────────
 *
 * `playToTheEnd` is played by the chronicler by design (see its own doc
 * comment) — that answers "what does the shipped game do", and is the
 * column the catastrophe band and the per-ending floors are read against.
 * It cannot answer "is Apotheosis reachable at all", because a house that
 * never plays for the ladder is not the house #22 is describing, and
 * #61's own trail measured this directly: `gate:ladder`'s `climb` and
 * `scion` columns diverge from `chronicler` by design, on exactly the
 * choices that decide whether the top of the ladder is ever reached.
 *
 * `ascendant` is a house pulling every lever the game gives a player for
 * building the ladder, at once: it takes Madness bargains like `climb`
 * (`answer`, `tools/ladder-policy.ts`), names and holds a Scion and Heir via the pair mechanism
 * (`nameScion` / `nameScionHeir`), and marries in like `blood-gate.ts`'s `marry_in`.
 * Unlike `gate:ladder`'s three columns — deliberately one verb apart to
 * isolate a single mechanism — this is the composite on purpose: the
 * question here is whether the top is reachable to a house TRYING, not
 * which lever does the trying.
 *
 * It also gets a bid ceiling (`gate:ladder`'s own default, 600) that the
 * chronicler column has never had: `world.bidCeiling` defaults to 0, so
 * `playToTheEnd`'s chronicler has never bought a book at auction. Books were
 * a binding blocker in every ladder measurement on this issue; a composite
 * column that could not buy one would understate what a trying house can
 * reach for a reason unrelated to the ladder itself.
 *
 * `verdictOver`'s policy denominator (owner's decision 2, in #61's trail):
 * Apotheosis' 8–29% target (widened 2026-09-20 from the original 8–15%, low
 * bound unchanged, at the owner's request) is read against `ascendant`. The chronicler is
 * held only to non-zero and strictly below it — a game that hands a god to
 * a house that never played for one is not the game §22 describes.
