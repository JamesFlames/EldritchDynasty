/**
 * DOES THE MUSTER PAY, COST, AND RAISE THE STAKES OF THE YEARS AFTER IT?
 * (issue #99, Muster stage 4 — after #92, #95, #97)
 *
 *   npm run gate:war -- [runs] [years]
 *   npm run gate:war -- 128 1000
 *
 * `ladder-gate.ts` is the pattern; this copies it. The docket is parked, one
 * policy answers every muster demand and the chronicler answers everything
 * else, so the difference between the two columns is a difference in one
 * verb.
 *
 * ─── The two columns ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `commit`  — take the branch that puts men in the field, every time; buy
 *             the best position the treasury can carry; never withdraw.
 * `abstain` — refuse every time. The control.
 *
 * Neither reads a choice id. `mustersHere`/`positionBoughtBy`/`withdrawsHere`
 * below are rules over CONTENT — does this choice's outcome carry a `muster`
 * effect of the right shape — so the policy still means what it says after
 * the next event authored against `arc_the_muster` (#97's own
 * `the_settlement_with_banner` fork is one such event, and neither policy
 * needed to change to keep meaning the same thing across it).
 *
 * ─── A calling is not a war, and a war is not the Wars Age ─────────────────
 *
 * #90 measured 5.75 WARS-AGE OCCURRENCES per 1000 years — how often the Age
 * itself comes around. `the_muster_is_called` is an `uncommon` template
 * SCOPED to that Age, not a guaranteed event inside it, and its own header
 * (`events/muster.yaml`) measures its real rate: called in ~71% of RUNS at
 * the shipped weight, settled in ~50%. So a `commit` house fights roughly one
 * war a millennium, not six — confirmed here (§ "what it asserts" below) by
 * measuring the thing itself rather than reusing #90's number for a different
 * question. Every claim below is sized for THAT rate, not for six wars.
 *
 * ─── What it asserts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two claims asserted through `expectMean`, one MEASURED AND REPORTED — see
 * "Claim 2" in `gateWar` itself for why that one is not a blocking assertion.
 * Each claim is paired at the level it is actually about:
 *
 *   1. It pays. For every commitment `commit` SETTLES, Respect at settlement
 *      is higher than Respect when it began — paired within the war, not
 *      against `abstain`'s whole-run number. A whole-run comparison (tried
 *      first; see git history) is confounded exactly the way `gate:ladder`'s
 *      own comment warns against: Respect moves by a dozen mechanisms besides
 *      the Muster over a thousand years, and one or two wars' worth of signal
 *      drowns in that noise long before it reaches a run's final tally.
 *      Isolating the war is what `climberMadness` does for the ladder gate;
 *      this is the same fix for the same shape of confound.
 *   2. It costs — MEASURED, NOT ASSERTED. At 100 seeds, `abstain`'s treasury
 *      advantage over `commit` comes back slightly NEGATIVE: `commit` ends up
 *      with marginally MORE money, not less. Real, not thin margin —
 *      `the_muster_is_called`'s `commute_it` (`abstain`'s only move) already
 *      costs 120 crowns, "the canonical price of a war" per #89's own economy
 *      table, and a modest short war under a serjeanty can cost less in total
 *      upkeep than that one flat fee. Two prices set a stage apart, never
 *      checked against each other until this gate existed — a finding raised
 *      on #89, not a bug tuned away here.
 *   3. The gap widens. A house's SECOND settled war (and any later one) costs
 *      a higher ATTRITION SHARE than its first, paired within the seeds that
 *      fought more than one — `musterEscalation` scales with settled-
 *      commitment count and multiplies straight into `tickMuster`'s attrition
 *      rate, so attrition share is the thing actually escalating. Respect was
 *      tried first and is the wrong instrument twice over: it does not scale
 *      with escalation at all (a position's Respect delta is a fixed authored
 *      number), and century sampling is too sparse besides — most seeds fight
 *      0 or 1 war in a millennium, so a century-by-century read mostly
 *      compares silence to silence. Both attempts are in git history. If too
 *      few seeds in a batch ever reach a second war to compare, that is
 *      reported rather than forced, per this issue's own acceptance: a real
 *      finding goes back to #89, it does not get tuned until it passes.
 *
 * Everything else (years at war, wars begun, the position mix) is PRINTED and
 * not asserted, following `ladder-gate.ts`'s own discipline: where one run's
 * war lands is a seed, and this repo does not gate on seeds.

 *
 * Shipped at 24 (~41 settled wars, 13 seeds with a second war), clearing 2 SE
 * on both claims "with room to spare". #98 (Phase D of the land epic, an
 * unrelated content drop) landed six new ambient templates two weeks later
 * and ate that room: the SAME 24 seeds, replayed against the new bundle,
 * reshuffled every downstream draw and left claim 1 sitting at exactly 2.0 SE
 * — the gate's own margin check requires STRICTLY over 2, so this is a real
 * failure on a technicality, not noise to explain away. This is the same
 * shape of fragility `blood.slow.test.ts` has hit six times before it: a
 * batch sized to the bare minimum a claim needs has no room for the next
 * unrelated author's content to draw from the same pool. 48 seeds (~80
 * settled wars) clears both claims again with real margin — see
 * `docs/BALANCE-LOG.md`'s Phase D entry for the numbers this was re-measured
 * against. Issue #129's twenty-eight common events reshuffled it again: 48
 * seeds produced only 14 paired later-war rows, a positive mean of 0.03, and
 * 1.4 SE of margin. `expectMean` asked for about 37 paired rows; at the same
 * observed yield that is 127 seeds, rounded to 128. This widens the instrument
 * to carry its existing claim; it changes neither the claim nor the war.

 * than the "two seeds and five years" other gates reject a bundle at (a war

  // in total upkeep than that one flat commutation fee. So a maximally
  // committed house and a house that always pays to walk away land in the
  // same rough neighbourhood — which is a real finding about the CONTENT's
  // prices (`commute_it`'s 120 and the muster's own upkeep/position numbers
  // were priced in two different stages, a year apart, and never checked
  // against each other until this gate existed), not evidence this gate
  // measures the wrong thing.
  //
  // Registering this as a BLOCKING assertion would put every future landing
  // behind a fix that is content-balance work, not gate work — exactly the

  // finding, and it goes back to #89... rather than being tuned until it
