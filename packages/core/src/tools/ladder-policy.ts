 * THE LADDER POLICIES, ON THEIR OWN (issue #61, Stage D).

 * why these exist — `climb`/`spare` isolate whether Madness bargains are
 * taken, `scion` isolates whether the house has named somebody to build the
 * ladder on. Read that file's header before changing anything here.
 *
 * The reason this moved: `ending-gate.ts` needs the SAME "one policy answers
 * every ladder bargain, the chronicler answers everything else" machinery to
 * build its own climbing column (issue #61's Stage D2) — not a copy of it.
 * `gates.ts` already imports `firedUnderClimbing` from `ladder-gate.js` for
 * exactly this reason (gate 8's acquittal pass), so a second file reusing the
 * policy machinery under `ending-gate.ts` rather than under `ladder-gate.ts`
 * is the same move already made once, not a new one.

 * man's Vessel and Great Rite are ladder bargains by construction
 * (`costsTheClimber` sees them, correctly), so under `pair` the house is
 * offered `the_second_name` and turns it down every single time, and the
 * column measures a scene nobody ever takes.
 *
 * So: `pair` plus `climb`, one verb apart from each, and the comparison that
