/**
 * IS BEARING A MORAL OR A TAX? (concept §29, issue #45's acceptance)
 *
 *   npm run gate:bearing -- [runs] [years]
 *   npm run gate:bearing -- 24 1000
 *
 * §29's whole design rests on one asymmetry, and the issue states it as the
 * test rather than as a hope:
 *
 *   > Across runs binned by bearing: high-bearing runs reach HIGHER rungs on
 *   > average AND show materially higher variance in outcome. If they are
 *   > simply worse, this is a difficulty setting and players will play around
 *   > it rather than feel it.
 *
 * A tax is a number that goes down. A moral is a bargain that usually pays and
 * occasionally ruins you, and the difference between those two is visible only
 * in a distribution — which is why this is a batch tool and not an assertion
 * about a seed.
 *
 * ─── The three columns ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Like `gate:blood` and `gate:ladder`, this PLAYS: the docket is parked and one
 * policy answers the two decisions §29 is about — the Match and the Record —
 * while the chronicler answers everything else, so the columns differ by how
 * the house CARRIES itself and by nothing else.
 *
 *   proud       takes the cousin where there is one and refuses the hand where
 *               there is not, holds every carrying daughter off the market, and
 *               writes the family larger at every Record block. All four of
 *               `BearingAct`'s acts, played deliberately.
 *   modest      takes a card every time and takes the outsider, releases
 *               everybody, and records honestly. The house that does the
 *               correct, dilute, well-liked thing for a thousand years.
 *   unattended  the chronicler decides. The control, and the shape of a run
 *               nobody is playing.
 *
 * ─── What it asserts, and what it only prints ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Asserted: the top bearing bin reaches a higher mean RUNG than the bottom
 * one. That is §29 rule 2 — *pride must usually be CORRECT* — and the shape is
 * a GRADIENT from the bottom bin to the top rather than a strict monotone. Top
 * minus bottom is +0.05 and +0.25 across two seed sets at sixty runs a column,
 * against a standard error near 0.05. Pride climbs.
 *
 * ─── THE COLUMN THIS IS READ OFF, WHICH WAS THE WRONG ONE ───────────────────
 *
 * The acceptance asks for higher variance IN OUTCOME. For three rounds of
 * measurement this gate read that spread off `bestRungIndex` — the ladder, out
 * of `world.ascension`, which is what the house ACHIEVED and which the last
 * night never consults. It reported the spread flat (−0.04, replicated) and
 * two conclusions were published off it: that stage 3's first bite had doubled
 * the gap, and later that warning lanes were not the lever.
 *
 * §29.3's third bite — the record read back — changes what a house can PROVE
 * and by construction leaves what it achieved alone. So that column could not
 * have moved however hard any of it bit. `substantiatedRungIndex` is where the
 * house ARRIVED, and it is what `selectEnding` actually reads.
 *
 * Measured on it, at sixty runs a column on two independent seed sets, with
 * all three bites built: **+0.11 and +0.15**. The top bin is wider in both,
 * where the ladder column was narrower in both. That is the first time the
 * second half of this acceptance has held.
 *
 * It is PRINTED rather than gated even so. Two samples agree on a sign, which
 * is not enough to fix a level, and a floor on a difference a batch can barely
 * see is how a gate stops meaning anything.
 *
 * AND DO NOT READ A RESULT OFF ONE BATCH OF IT. Measured on identical content,
 * a single bin's variance swings by up to 0.10 from nothing but the seeds (the
 * middle bin came out 0.26 and 0.16), which is larger than any movement a
 * content drop has ever produced in it. Quote the top-minus-bottom statistic,
 * across at least two seed sets — `npm run gate:bearing -- 60 1000 9001 17`
 * gives an independent one. This paragraph exists because the first
 * measurement here credited a content drop with doubling a gap whose noise
 * floor is three times the gap, and the mean-outcome column has already caught
 * one more: it read −0.20 on one set and +0.02 on the other, so *the proud
 * house arrives lower* is a sentence one batch supports and two do not.
 *
 * NOT IN `npm run gate`, for the same reason `gate:blood` and `gate:drag` are
 * not: the rung assertion is a two-standard-error effect at eighty-four runs a
 * bin and is meaningless at the dozen a CI budget allows. It is an instrument
 * you point at the question, not a tripwire.
 *
 * Printed and not asserted: standing, clauses and household size at 2042. They
 * are the texture of the distribution rather than its subject, and where any
 * one run lands on them is a seed.

/**
 * THE FLOOR UNDER §29.7'S SECOND CLAUSE (issue #76), AND WHY IT IS ZERO.
 *
 * The clause asks high-bearing runs to reach higher rungs on average AND to
 * arrive more VARIOUSLY. The first half has been judged since this gate was
 * written. The second was printed for three rounds because two seed sets agree
 * on a sign and do not fix a level, and this repo carries five tests that broke
 * on thresholds set just under a measurement.
 *
 * Four independent seed sets, 60 runs a column, 720 played thousand-year runs,
 * measured on the game as it stands:
 *
 *     4000+13i   +0.06
 *     9001+17i   +0.13
 *    20011+29i   +0.12
 *    31013+37i   +0.03
 *
 *    mean +0.085 · sd of one batch 0.048 · se of the four-batch mean 0.024
 *
 * Positive in four of four, and the mean stands 3.5 standard errors above
 * zero. The effect is real.
 *
 * THE FLOOR IS STILL ZERO, AND THE ARITHMETIC IS THE POINT. Two standard
 * errors below the mean is +0.037 if you use the se of the MEAN — and that is
 * the wrong dispersion, because this gate judges ONE batch and not the average
 * of four. What a single 60-a-column batch scatters by is 0.048, and two of
 * those below +0.085 is NEGATIVE. No positive floor is carryable at that size,
 * and +0.037 would have failed the 31013 set on the very measurement that
 * justified it.
 *
 * So the floor is the failure §29.7 actually names — the top bin no wider than
 * the bottom — tested STRICTLY, since equal width is no wider. And the batch is
 * required to be large enough to say it: 0.085 over 0.048 is 1.8 sd at 60 a
 * column, and 76 a column brings that past two. Rounded to 80, which is
 * `SPREAD_MIN_RUNS / 3`.
 *
 * WHAT WOULD RAISE IT. Not a bigger batch — that buys margin, not level. The
 * level moves when the third bite bites harder, and the number to watch is the
 * BOTTOM bin's `withheld`: it ran 0.02-0.08 across these four sets, and a
 * mechanism that starts discounting the quiet house too narrows this gap
 * without the proud house changing at all.
 *
 * Re-measuring costs four commands and about 45 minutes at four in parallel on
 * a four-core container:
 *
 *   npm run gate:bearing -- 60 1000 4000 13
 *   npm run gate:bearing -- 60 1000 9001 17
