/**
 * CI GATES — checks that are only worth writing once the thing they guard
 * exists, so each subcommand lands in the commit that makes it non-vacuous
 * (issue #6) rather than being authored speculatively against a shape that
 * might still change.
 *
 *   npx tsx packages/core/src/tools/gates.ts <subcommand>
 *
 * Every subcommand prints what it measured and exits non-zero on failure, so
 * CI can call it directly.
 *
 * EVERY GATE IS A FUNCTION OVER A BUNDLE, and returns its verdict rather than
 * printing it. That is not tidiness: a gate nobody has ever seen fail is
 * indistinguishable from a gate that cannot fail, and the only way to tell the
 * two apart is to hand one a bundle it must reject and watch it do so. The
 * slow gates take their sample size as an argument for the same reason —
 * `gates.test.ts` runs them at two seeds and five years, which is far too
 * small to mean anything about the game and exactly the right size to prove
 * the gate still has teeth.

 * slot it was pointed at — found by a coverage survey, not by the game,
 * because no content has ever used it.
 *
 * THREE QUESTIONS, AND THE THIRD IS THE ONE NOTHING ELSE ASKS:
 *
 *   declared   the closed union, read off the Zod schema via `vocabulary()`
 *              rather than a list in this file — invariant 5's rule about
 *              hand-kept copies applies to gates too
 *   authored   some outcome, somewhere in the content, carries the kind
 *   reached    a played run RESOLVED an outcome that carries it
 *
 * IT PLAYS NOTHING. Every resolution it needs is already in the batch gates 4
 * and 8 share, so this gate is post-processing over runs somebody else has
 * paid for — which is why it can afford to be in CI at 250 runs.
 *
 * A kind that is declared and not authored FAILS. That is the invariant,
 * stated plainly: if the verb exists, some content uses it, or it should not
 * exist. Authored-but-unreached is reported and does not fail on its own —
 * gate 8 already owns "an authored branch nobody reaches" and owns it with a
 * proper power calculation, so convicting on it here would be a second, worse
 * instrument for a question that already has a good one.

 * (issue #45) both return `{ ok, lines }` — structurally identical to
 * `GateResult` — and neither was in this table, so `npm run gate` never called
 * them and CI never asked either question of shipped content. Each had a unit
 * test against hand-built runs, which proves the verdict logic and says
 * nothing about the game.
 *
 * That is gate 2's own history repeating: written for CI, wired into nothing,
 * for its whole life. The comment at the bottom of this file already says it —
 * "a gate outside this table is a gate CI does not run" — and the table it
 * refers to did not contain these two.
 *
 * ONLY ONE OF THEM IS REGISTERED, and the difference matters.
 *
 * `gateEndings` PASSES the shipped game, so leaving it out was pure oversight
 * — the same oversight as gate 2 — and it is in the table now at its own
 * default of 24 runs. Its output also carries issue #61 in plain sight
 * (`apotheosis 0 0.0%`), which is worth having in front of everyone on every
 * push rather than in a tool nobody runs.
 *
 * `gateBearing` FAILS it, measured 2026-09-06 at its default of 12 runs:
 *
 *   FAIL: the house that carried itself does not reach higher rungs than the
 *   one that kept its head down — §29 rule 2 says pride must usually be
 *   CORRECT
 *
 * That is issue #45 still being open, not a wiring mistake, and registering a
 * red gate would say "the build is broken" every push about a design question
 * nobody is currently answering. It is also UNDER-POWERED at its default: the
 * gate's own output says the spread claim needs 240 runs and is printed
 * rather than judged at 36. A gate CI runs at a batch that cannot carry its
 * claim is the exact failure `expectRate` exists to prevent, one level up.
 *
 * So it stays out, on purpose and in writing, until #45 closes — run it with
 * `npm run gate:bearing -- 80 1000`. `gates.test.ts` pins the registry, so
 * adding it is a deliberate edit in two places rather than a thing that
 * happens by accident.

/**
 * ── CI LANES: WHICH GATES SHARE A RUNNER ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The gates job was ONE runner and had quietly become the longest thing in
 * CI. Measured off the timestamps in run 123's own log (`main`, green):
 *
 *   war 16m38s · fire-rate 16m05s · endings 95s · clauses 49s · ladder 45s
 *   ladder-scales 30s · outcome-reach 0.003s · vocabulary-reach 0.004s
 *   purposes ~0s · slot-fillability 0.07s        ── 36m24s in total
 *
 * TWO GATES ARE NINETY PER CENT OF IT, and they are ninety per cent of it for
 * unrelated reasons: `war` plays 128 runs x 1000 years across two policy
 * columns, and `fire-rate` plays the 250-run batch. `check.yml` had been
 * claiming `gates 8m38s` since run 98 — `gate:war` and `gate:land` were added
 * on 8-9 September and nobody re-measured, which is this repository's own
 * lesson about perishable timing comments, applied to the file that states it.
 *
 * SO THE SPLIT IS TWO RUNNERS, AND `playBatch` DECIDES WHERE IT FALLS.
 * `outcome-reach` and `vocabulary-reach` cost THREE AND FOUR MILLISECONDS —
 * they read the batch `fire-rate` already paid for. Separating them from it
 * would play those 250 runs twice and turn two free gates into sixteen
 * minutes each. `war` shares its runs with nothing, so it is the one gate
 * that can leave without taking a batch with it.
 *
 * A LANE IS NOT A LIST OF GATES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. Only the gates that
 * need a runner of their own are named; `batch` is DERIVED as everything
 * else. This is the argument `check.yml` already makes about iterating
 * `GATES` rather than naming gates in a workflow — "gate 2 was written for CI
 * and wired into nothing for its whole life under the old hand-kept list" —
 * and it holds one level down: a gate added tomorrow is in CI the moment it
 * exists, in `batch`, without anybody editing this table or the workflow.
 *
 * What that cannot notice is a new gate that is EXPENSIVE. It lands in
 * `batch` and makes that lane slow, which is a cost regression and not a
 * correctness one — the gate still runs, and `npm run cost` is what says so.
