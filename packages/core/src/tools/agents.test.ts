/**
 * THE MUTEX THAT LETS SEVERAL AGENTS SHARE THIS REPOSITORY.
 *
 * `tools/agents.mjs` is the claim tool — see docs/PARALLEL.md. It lives at the
 * repository root as plain `.mjs` rather than in this directory as TypeScript
 * because an agent runs it before it has decided whether to `npm install`, and
 * `tsx` is a dependency. The test belongs here, where the suite is.
 *
 * What is worth testing is exactly one thing: that two agents cannot both hold
 * one issue. Everything else the tool does is printing. And the failure it
 * guards is the quiet kind this codebase specialises in — two sessions working
 * the same issue for an afternoon look, from inside either one, precisely like
 * one session working it.
 *
 * So the test stands up a bare repository and two clones of it, and races them.
 * The guarantee being leaned on is git's own: a push that creates a ref which
 * already exists, carrying a commit that is not a descendant of the one there,
 * is rejected by the receiving end. The claim commits are ORPHANS, so no second
 * claim can ever be a descendant of the first, so the second push always loses.
