/**
 * WHAT THE PLAYER IS ASKED, AND HOW OFTEN THE SAME THING TWICE (issue #88).
 *
 *   npm run gate:density -- [runs] [years]
 *   npm run gate:density -- 12 500 300
 *
 * ─── The finding this exists to settle ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `choice` is about three-quarters of every decision in the game, and always
 * was. The ceiling that was supposed to catch a kind eating the run passed for
 * years only because naming — a form, 37% of the budget, a prompt per child —
 * was padding the denominator. Take the form out (#62) and `choice` reads 75%
 * without one extra event firing.
 *
 * #88 asks whether that is the intended density or an artefact of every phase
 * being allowed to present, and it names one dial: `EVENT_BUDGET_PER_YEAR` in
 * `year/phases.ts`, spent once a year in the `ambient` phase. Nothing else in
 * the game rations choice — arc steps present their due nodes outside the
 * budget, and `selectEvents` returns forced candidates before it spends any.
 *
 * ─── Why the count is the wrong instrument, and what this measures instead ──
 *
 * The complaint underneath a density complaint is almost never the count. It
 * is repetition: 300 draws over a pool of 454 templates is #86's rota and
 * #85's flat century arriving from a third direction, and lowering the budget
 * would make a thin game shorter rather than a repetitive game varied.
 *
 * So this measures the thing the player HAS rather than the thing the engine
 * spends:
 *
 *   `repeatRun`   the share of choice presentations whose template has already
 *                 fired in this run. The treadmill, as one number.
 *   `repeatAge`   the same question inside the current Age, which is the unit
 *                 a session is now (#65) and the scale repetition is felt at.
 *                 `the_plague` medians six years and `the_long_peace` 98, so
 *                 these two numbers are different questions.
 *   `ordinary`    the longest span of consecutive years carrying no Match, no
 *                 Record block and no Age boundary — how long the game can go
 *                 presenting nothing but ambient choice panels. If the density
 *                 problem is really a DISTRIBUTION problem, it is here.
 *   `reach`       distinct choice templates the run actually reached. A pool
 *                 that grew 12% buys nothing if the draw never gets to it.
 *
 * And the campaign-invariant counts beside them — per generation and per Age —
 * because #133 has moved the Long Line from 1,000 years to 500 and a raw count
 * per campaign is a product-load figure, not a balance target. Per generation
 * is the same number in both campaigns if the design is the same design.
 *
 * ─── It prints; it does not judge ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The regression band lives in `attention.slow.test.ts`, where the rest of the
 * attention budget is guarded, because that file already pays for a played
 * batch and a second one in `tools/gates.ts` would play the same years twice
 * for the same answer. This is the sweep rig that produced the band.

 * applies the record itself and nothing is ever docketed. Measured with
 * `autoResolveAll` this read **one** Record block per 500-year run against the
