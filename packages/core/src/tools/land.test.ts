/**
 * THE LANDING RUNS WHAT CI RUNS, AND THE SET IS DERIVED RATHER THAN REMEMBERED.
 *
 * AGENTS.md grants standing authorisation to fast-forward `main` with no pull
 * request as soon as `npm run check` is green. `check` is
 * `typecheck && validate && test`. CI runs the gates too — measured runs that
 * `check` has never touched, and which were nine minutes when this was
 * written and are better than half an hour now (see `check.yml`'s own
 * re-measured block, and note that the figure in this sentence went stale
 * the same way the ones it replaced did).
 *
 * THE JOB COUNT IS DELIBERATELY NOT STATED HERE ANY MORE. It was "three",
 * and three was true until the test job became a four-way shard matrix and
 * the gates became two lanes. `ciScripts` never counted jobs — it reads npm
 * invocations — so the derivation kept working and only the prose was wrong,
 * which is the cheaper half of this file being right.
 *
 * Four of the eleven red runs of `check.yml` on `main` across runs 61-100
 * failed at exactly that step. Runs 64 and 65 are the clearest: typecheck,
 * validate and the whole test suite green, forty-one minutes of it, then
 * `gates` red. Both agents did what the rulebook said and broke trunk anyway.
 *
 * `tools/land.mjs` is the command that closes it. This is the test that keeps
 * it closed, and the thing it guards is not today's four steps — it is the
 * FOURTH JOB nobody has written yet. check.yml already makes this argument
 * about its own gate list:
 *
 *   "The gates are not split by name, deliberately. `npm run gate` runs
 *    whatever is in `GATES`, so a new gate is in CI the moment it exists rather
 *    than the moment somebody remembers this file — gate 2 was written for CI
 *    and wired into nothing for its whole life under the old hand-kept list."
 *
 * A landing command that names its own steps has that failure mode one level
 * up, and it is worse there: a forgotten gate costs a red build, a forgotten
 * JOB costs a red `main` that the agent responsible has already stopped
 * watching.

/**
 * WHAT IT VERIFIES MUST BE WHAT IT PUSHES, AND ONE LANDING AT A TIME.
 *
 * Three failures on 2026-09-07 came from one shape. `land` ran its steps
 * against the live working tree and then pushed `HEAD:main`, which resolves
 * half an hour later:
 *
 *   9/9 gates pass
 *   $ git push origin HEAD:main
 *      ac12cda..02183f5  HEAD -> main
 *
 * That landing started at 891cac5 and verified 891cac5. `02183f5` was
 * committed while it ran and had been through no step at all. It reached trunk
 * under a green banner and CI failed it.
 *
 * It happened because a live landing was read as a dead one — empty log, no
 * `vitest` process, both equally consistent with "between steps" — and a
 * second was started over the same checkout.
 *
 * Both assertions below are from the SECOND actor's point of view, which is
 * the same choice `agents.test.ts` makes about the claim mutex: whether the
 * internals changed is an implementation detail, whether the other party is
 * stopped is the entire point.
