/**
 * THE DEATH-SPIRAL GATE for fertility option B (issue #26).
 *
 *   npm run gate:drag -- [runs] [years] [coupling ...] [--pleiotropic]
 *   npm run gate:drag -- [runs] [years] [coupling ...] [--phased] [--cm=N]
 *   npm run gate:drag -- 8 1000 2 --phased --decay
 *   npm run gate:drag -- 200 1000 0 0.5 1 2 4
 *   npm run gate:drag -- 200 1000 0 1 2 4 --pleiotropic
 *
 * TWO MECHANISMS, one gate. `--pleiotropic` runs option B respecified: the
 * drag carried on the font loci themselves rather than on a linked group
 * beside them. `coupledBundle` documents why there are two, and k is
 * calibrated so a row of one is comparable to a row of the other.
 *
 * Issue #26 ships `FECUNDITY_DRAG_COUPLING` at zero and names the condition
 * for ever moving it: "turn the constant up in the harness, in batches of two
 * hundred runs, and look for the death spiral before anyone plays it. If a
 * house that concentrates its blood cannot reach 2042 more than half the
 * time, the constant is wrong — not the idea." This file is that batch.
 *
 * HOW IT REACHES A NONZERO COUPLING WITHOUT A DIAL.
 * `FECUNDITY_DRAG_COUPLING` is a `const` on purpose (INVARIANT 8: no
 * module-scope mutable state a second simulation in the same process could
 * see differently), so a sweep cannot turn it up — and an env var read at
 * import time would be worse, because then a saved game would replay
 * differently on a machine whose shell disagreed.
 *
 * So the sweep does not touch the constant at all. It builds a synthetic
 * CONTENT bundle per coupling: every `fecundity_drag` locus is relabelled
 * `additive` — the kind `couplingFor` multiplies by one — and its authored
 * weight is multiplied by k instead. Nothing else about the locus moves:
 * same id, same X, same position, same dominance, same alleles, same
 * frequencies. `drawAllele` and `meiosis` special-case neither kind, so the
 * genome layout and the whole RNG cascade are identical to the shipped run;
 * the only difference reaching the simulation is the number
 * `expressAttributes` multiplies by. That makes k a per-world property of
 * content rather than a global, which is what the invariant actually asks for.
 *
 * `fecundity-drag.slow.test.ts` pins the fidelity claim: the k=0 bundle this
 * file builds must produce a bit-identical run to the shipped content.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, and why each column is here.
 *  - survive: the gate's own pass/fail line.
 *  - squeeze: children borne by high-font women against low-font women. A
 *    coupling that does not separate those two columns has not implemented
 *    the design, whatever it does to the loci.
 *  - font 1st/last: carried font of the house's first daughters against its
 *    last. The death spiral is not only extinction — a house that reaches
 *    2042 having quietly bred its font away has lost a slower way, and the
 *    survival column cannot see it.
 *  - centre, floored: the two diagnostics the first batch turned out to
 *    need. `centre` is `expectedAttribute('fecundity')`, the theoretical
 *    mean `completedFertility` measures every couple against; `floored` is
 *    the share of real mothers sitting on the attribute's own zero. When
 *    those two disagree — a negative centre and a floored population — every
 *    family in the game reads as ABOVE average and the drag hands out
 *    children instead of taking them.

/**
 * THE RESPECIFICATION, and why there are two mechanisms in one gate.
 *
 * `linked` is issue #26 as written: a separate locus group on the X, a few
 * centiMorgans from the font. Three batches have now measured it and it does
 * not do the thing it was specified to do, for a reason that is about the
 * shape of the mechanism rather than about the strength of the constant —
 * **linkage preserves a pairing, it cannot create one.** The founders' drag
 * alleles are drawn from the world baseline independently of their font
 * (r = -0.07), every wife married in brings another X drawn the same way, and
 * a haplotype carrying both font and drag is precisely the haplotype that
 * breeds least, so the mechanism eats its own premise. Supplying the premise
 * by hand (`--phased`) produces the intended sign and it is gone inside a
 * quarter of the run, at any linkage distance.
 *
 * `pleiotropic` is the form named in that finding and never measured: the
 * negative `fecundity` contribution sits **on the `eldritch_font` loci
 * themselves**. Then the correlation is structural — it cannot be recombined
 * apart, diluted out or selected away, and it scales with font depth, which is
 * what "the blood you are trying to concentrate is the blood that breeds
 * least" actually claims. It also predicts its way out of the floor that
 * killed the linked form: the great majority of the world carries no font at
 * all — an outsider draws it only at their pool's carrier rate, five percent
 * in the deepest-blooded rival house and under one in most — so almost nobody
 * pays the drag, and only the hot minority is pushed toward zero.
 *
 * That same sentence is also this form's blocker, which is not a coincidence:
 * `expectedAttribute` reads the AUTHORED frequencies and `drawAllele`
 * overrides them for exactly this locus kind, so the centre falls much faster
 * than the population does. Read `borne` beside `centre` in every row. See
 * docs/FAILURES.md, "a locus that is drawn by its own rule".
 *
 * The cost is the jackpot. A crossover can no longer hand anyone deep font
 * without the drag, because there is nothing to cross over. That is the trade
 * this gate exists to price.
 *
 * ONE KNOWN ARTIFACT at k>0, named because it is a real consequence rather
 * than an accident of the tool: making the font loci feed an attribute makes
 * them reachable by `bias`, and one template in the deck biases fecundity —
 * `suitor_widow_with_land`, who would therefore be dealt with her font written
 * as well as her fertility. She is an outsider from `house_calder` or the
 * commons who draws at a carrier rate under 3% and would almost always carry
 * none anyway, so it moves nothing measured here. It would matter a great deal
 * if this ever shipped, and that is the point of writing it down.

/**
 * PHASE THE FOUNDERS — the variant the first batch proved this gate needs.

 * Issue #26 reasons that putting the drag loci on the X, linked to the font,

 * Linkage does not do that. Linkage PRESERVES a pairing; it cannot create
 * one, and the pairing the founders were rolled with is random — measured at
 * r = -0.07 between carried font and drag load, which is nothing. Sharing a
 * chromosome makes two loci travel together; it says nothing about which
 * alleles set out together in the first place.
 *
 * So this is the same experiment with the missing premise supplied: on every
 * founding genome of the player's house, each drag locus is set to match the
 * font locus it is paired with, on the SAME haplotype — a hot X carries the
 * drag, a cold X does not. From there the simulation is untouched: meiosis
 * splits the pair at whatever rate the authored centiMorgans allow, and the
 * jackpot the issue describes (deep font, split loose from the drag) is a
 * thing recombination has to hand you rather than a thing set up in advance.
 *
 * It is deliberately a property of THIS TOOL and not of `bootstrap`. Shipping
 * it would mean authoring the founder's haplotypes in content, which is a
 * design decision the gate exists to inform, not one it should pre-empt.
