/**
 * DOES THE LADDER CHARGE THE MAN WHO IS CLIMBING IT? (issue #41, second half)
 *
 *   npm run gate:ladder -- [runs] [years] [--bid=N]
 *   npm run gate:ladder -- 8 1000
 *
 * `ascension.ts` writes the finding this tool exists to close on the
 * Hierophant gate itself:
 *
 *   > if (p.madness < 20) return 'nothing has been asked of him that cost
 *   > anything';
 *
 * Measured over sixteen played thousand-year runs before this file existed,
 * that line was the last thing standing between the house and the fourth
 * rung — men at power 57 with ten books, eight affinities and Madness ZERO.
 * And it could not be fixed by moving a constant: power is `min(font,
 * ceiling)` and blood-Madness is `(font - ceiling) x 0.85`, the same
 * subtraction with opposite signs, so halving `MADNESS_OVERFLOW_YEARS`
 * doubled the ruin and moved the ladder not one rung in eight of eight runs.
 *
 * A ladder that runs through Madness has to be charged by CONTENT, and until
 * `events/the_ladder.yaml` every one of the game's authored `madness` effects
 * landed on a POSITION — HEAD, BEARER, CHILD, SECOND — while the ladder is
 * climbed by whoever the blood happened to land in.
 *
 * ─── The two columns ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Like `gate:blood`, this PLAYS: the docket is parked, one policy answers
 * every ladder demand and the chronicler answers everything else, so the
 * difference between two columns is a difference in one verb.
 *
 * `climb` takes the branch that costs the man something, every time.
 * `spare`  refuses it, every time, and is the control.
 *
 * Neither reads a choice id. The policy is a rule over CONTENT — take (or
 * refuse) the branch whose outcomes deal Madness to somebody — so it still
 * means what it says after the next event is authored, and a list of ids
 * would not.
 *
 * ─── What it asserts ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two things, and neither of them is a rung. `climb` must end with more
 * Madness on the man standing highest than `spare` does — that is the
 * mechanism, and asserting the mechanism rather than a seed is this repo's
 * own rule. And the Madness floor must stop being the thing that blocks the
 * fourth rung in the climbing column, because that is what the gate text
 * says is wrong.
 *
 * What blocks it INSTEAD is printed rather than judged. When this was
 * written, it was books and power, and that is a library and a genetics
 * question rather than this one.
 *
 * The ceiling each column reaches is printed for the same reason and asserted
 * for none: where one run's ladder stops is a seed, and this repo does not
 * gate on seeds. See the comment beside the line that prints it. The `scion`
 * column (below) is printed on the same reasoning, for the same reason.
 *
 * ─── A third column: `scion` (issue #61) ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `climb` and `spare` differ in one verb — whether Madness bargains are taken.
 * `scion` differs from `spare` in a DIFFERENT one verb: whether the house has
 * named somebody to build the ladder on. It refuses every Madness bargain
 * exactly like `spare` does, so the gap between the two isolates naming a
 * scion rather than mixing it with the cost of climbing.
 *
 * Measured at the point this issue was picked up: seven of eight blockers in
 * the climbing column were the Vessel's power gate, missing by three to
 * fourteen points, and #61's own earlier measurement already priced
 * concentrating a WHOLE HOUSE's marriages at seven points at the ceiling over
 * many hundreds of weddings — almost exactly that gap. `nameScion` plays the
 * oracle a real player approximates: an attentive house always has SOMEBODY
 * named, and holds him for life rather than re-litigating the choice every
 * time a nephew edges ahead, which would spend the bias on a different man
 * every few years and concentrate nothing.
 *
 * `latePower` (see its own doc comment) is printed rather than asserted, and
 * the reason changed shape as the mechanism grew. Stage A (the marriage
 * alone) was small and steady: on twenty seeds outside the default set,
 * `scion` beat `spare` on 2, tied on 16, lost on 2 — a mean move under two
 * points, in a range this batch could not call but that never swung hard
 * either way. Stage B (the longest useful book, a term in mind, no post)
 * and Stage C (the cost, and the vacancy noticed) made the SAME comparison
 * far noisier rather than more decisive: on the same twenty seeds, `scion`
 * beat `spare` on 9, tied on 4, and lost on 7, with individual seeds moving
 * by as much as fifty points in either direction. The mean still edges
 * positive, barely. Concentrating everything onto one man raises the
 * ceiling he can reach when his book and his blood both land, and lowers it
 * when they do not, which is a different claim from Stage A's steadier one
 * and not a smaller one to prove — a bigger batch, not a bigger opinion,
 * is what would settle it. `table.test.ts` proves every piece of the
 * mechanism fires deterministically on its own; what no column here yet
 * shows is whether the variance nets out kindly over enough centuries, and
 * that is a claim for #85's own accumulation work to make, not this gate.

/**
 * A FLOOR AND NOT A TARGET, set the way gate 4's fire-rate floor was: far
 * enough below where the content stands that it never argues with an author,
 * close enough to matter before somebody quietly removes the last bargain.
 * Measured over twelve played thousand-year runs at the time of writing:
 *
 *     climb  deepest Madness on a man on the ladder 40.8   ladder-years past the floor 21%
 *     spare  deepest Madness on a man on the ladder  9.4   ladder-years past the floor  2%
 *
 * Five per cent is a quarter of where the climbing column stands and more
 * than twice where the sparing one does, which is the gap this is here to
 * keep open.
 *
 * Asserted of the climbing column only. A house whose player refuses every
 * bargain SHOULD arrive at the gate with a whole man and no Madness — that is
 * the bargain being real, and it is the control this gate is built around.
