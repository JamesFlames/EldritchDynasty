/**
 * IS THE FOUNDING BOTTLENECK'S RECOVERY POSSIBLE? (issue #132, Stage 2)
 *
 *   npm run gate:bottleneck -- [runs] [years]
 *   npm run gate:bottleneck -- 150 1000
 *
 * Stage 1 recalibrated `thinBloodMortality`/`thinBloodFertility` so a
 * founding house's own first ordinary death stops spiraling into extinction
 * on its own — measured, `broken_line` fell from 33-39% of runs to roughly
 * half that. What it did not do, and never claimed to: give a thinned line
 * anything to do about it. Measured on the recalibrated code, before Stage 2
 * existed: **0 of 37 surviving runs, then 0 of 45, then 0 of 60** — three
 * re-measurements across this issue's own trail, each one naming a different
 * reason a line down to one or two could never climb back. `descentKind`
 * makes recovery from EXACTLY zero blood structurally impossible (the run
 * ends the year it happens, issue #42) — this gate is not about that. It is
 * about the runs that touch one or two and do not have to end there.
 *
 * ─── What Stage 2 built, and what actually blocked it three times over ────
 *
 * Two content events (`marriage.yaml`), cast on the crisis and gated on a
 * new `bloodCount` condition; a `marriage: end` effect and a `priorityMatch`
 * effect the player's choice can reach for. Three separate bugs sat between
 * "the mechanism exists" and "it does anything", found only by playing real
 * batches and tracing a seed at a time — none visible from the code alone:
 *
 *   1. `bloodCount` was not a recognised PRESSURE signal (`selection.ts`), so
 *      the crisis scene competed in the whole common-tier ambient pool
 *      instead of the small pool a real emergency draws from. Fired in 2 of
 *      14 windows where it was eligible and a candidate existed to cast.
 *   2. `matchSubjects` waived the marriageable age ceiling for a
 *      priority-flagged person; `takeCard` — the function that actually
 *      marries them — did not, and refused the very hand the priority exists
 *      to win. The same failure `eligibleToMarry`'s own comment already
 *      documents once: two files asking the same question and disagreeing.
 *   3. `sole_heir_spent` cast a CADET as readily as the seat's own blood,
 *      because `w.people.blood` answers a lineage question and the Match
 *      only ever deals hands to the main hall. A priority nothing downstream
 *      could act on — the house went to market for one for eleven years.
 *
 * Fixed, all three are needed together before recovery happens at all:
 * measured post-fix at 150 seeds, **3 of 46 runs that touched 1 or 2 living
 * blood reached the term anyway — 6.5%, non-zero, where it had been 0 of 60
 * across three separate measurements.** Full trail in `docs/BALANCE-LOG.md`.
 *
 * ─── Why this is a gate and not only a `.slow.test.ts` claim ──────────────
 *
 * `gates.ts`'s own rule: a gate nobody has seen fail is indistinguishable
 * from a gate that cannot fail. `verdictOver` is a pure function over played
 * runs, so `bottleneck-gate.test.ts` can hand it a batch that touched the
 * bottleneck forty times and recovered not once — the exact shape of every
 * measurement on this trail before the three bugs above were found.
