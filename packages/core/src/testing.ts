 * assert the SHAPE OF A HEALTHY RUN, and there is no way to check that except

 * ─── BATCH CLAIMS, AND WHETHER THEY CAN CARRY THEIR OWN THRESHOLD ───────────
 *
 * Three tests in this suite have now broken on commits that changed nothing
 * they measured, and all three failed the same way: a threshold set by eye off
 * the same batch it was about to be tested on.
 *
 * `gives the family somewhere to quarrel with itself` is the clearest. It
 * counted feuds across twelve runs and asserted more than eight. Measured over
 * 48 seeds the underlying rate is 81%–90%, so at twelve runs that assertion
 * fails somewhere between one time in eleven and one time in four WITH NOTHING
 * WRONG. It duly went red on two household templates that fire under once a run
 * between them and create no grudges at all — because adding any template to
 * the pool re-rolls which scene wins every draw for a thousand years. That is
 * not a regression. It is what a shared draw means.
 *
 * The trouble is that a thin margin is INVISIBLE. A passing test looks exactly
 * like a well-powered one, right up until an unrelated commit spends its luck,
 * and then somebody reads a real finding into a coin landing tails.
 *
 * So the margin is asserted alongside the claim. `expectRate` fails twice over:
 * once if the claim is false, and once if the claim is true BY LUCK — if the
 * observed rate is not at least `MIN_MARGIN_SE` standard errors clear of the
 * floor. The second failure is not a bug report about the game. It is a bug
 * report about the test, and it says what to do: widen the batch.
 *
 * This is deliberately not a gate and not a lint. It runs inside the test that
 * makes the claim, on the batch that test actually ran, so it cannot drift out
 * of date and there is no second list for anybody to maintain.
 */

/**
 * How many standard errors a threshold must sit clear of the measured rate.
 *
 * Two. At two SE a claim survives about nineteen unrelated commits in twenty,

 * ── THE SHAPE OF A WORLD, ASSERTED WHEREVER ONE EXISTS ────────────────────
 *
 * Forty-three suites play millennia and, before this, not one of them asked
 * whether the world that came out was STRUCTURALLY COHERENT. They each
 * checked their own subsystem — did the ladder move, did the record drift,
 * did the branches grieve — and a widow still married to a dead man would
 * have passed every one of them, because no suite owns "marriages agree with
 * deaths".
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `docs/FAILURES.md` catalogues the exact shapes:
 * children in the wrong household, widows still married to dead men, cast
 * slots never refilled, the seal out of the main house twice. Every one is a
 * predicate over a single world, and every one shipped.
 *
 * So: one function, called at the tail of a run that already happened. It
 * costs nothing — the expensive part is the thousand years, and those are
 * already paid for.
 *
 * IT RETURNS VIOLATIONS RATHER THAN THROWING, like a gate. A throw gives you
 * the first thing wrong; a list tells you whether one person is broken or
 * four hundred are, which is the difference between a bug in `kill()` and a
 * bug in one authored effect.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT IN HERE IS DELIBERATE. Every check below is a rule the game
 * actually keeps — verified by running it over played millennia and deleting
 * the ones the world does not owe. A checker that fails on healthy runs gets
