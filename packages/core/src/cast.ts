/**
 * WHO THIS GENERATION IS ABOUT (issue #44, and issue #86).
 *
 * By 2042 a run holds about seventy living people across six halls, and there
 * are no faces by design. **A player asked to care about seventy people cares
 * about none of them** — and every beat the design is built on assumes
 * attachment that nothing was manufacturing: the Fragile One, the Vessel,
 * losing the Darkness-affine daughter in 1900.
 *
 * Attachment is a selection problem before it is an art problem, and it has
 * three conditions. NAMED shipped with the bynames and the dynastic ordinals.
 * EXPOSED TO LOSS the simulation has always done correctly. The missing one is
 * ONE DETAIL THAT IS ONLY TRUE OF THEM — something that distinguishes a person
 * from their sibling other than a number — which is what `because` is, and why
 * every line of it is a fact off this year's world rather than colour.
 *
 * Five to seven, not seventy.
 *
 * ─── A ROTA IS NOT A CAST (issue #86) ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The first cut had exactly seven roles for up to seven slots, so every one of
 * them that could be filled was filled, and the panel answered *who is this
 * generation about* with the constitutional offices of a household — the same
 * answer in every house in every century. Measured over four runs: `head` and
 * `heir` in 100% of sampled generations, `married_in` 95%, `aggrieved` 89%,
 * and the multiset of roles at 1200 identical to the one at 1900 in every
 * seed. Four hundred years apart it read as a template with the nouns swapped.
 *
 * So there are more roles than slots now, and **which roles appear is itself
 * the information**. Every candidate carries a SALIENCE — how unusual this
 * fact is, not how senior the person is — and the panel takes the head and
 * then the loudest few. A structural role has to earn its slot: an heir who
 * is simply the next man scores 14 and is crowded out by the hall that is
 * owed forty years of grievance, by the only expresser left alive, by the
 * bondsman whose loyalty is running out. `head` is the one anchor, because
 * somebody answers for the house and the player is deciding for him.
 *
 * The panel is allowed to be SHORT. Some decades are genuinely about three
 * people, and a list that always fills seven slots is a list padding itself.
 *
 * ─── This is also where #24 item 3 gets watched ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * Women hold the font, are usually the only safe people in the house, own the
 * endgame concealment instrument, and are barred from the one thing that wins
 * the game. The structure is coherent and the injustice is the point; the
 * failure mode is a player who reads the male line as the game and the
 * daughters as inventory. The tracker calls that the largest remaining design
 * risk in the genetics, and it is a UI problem rather than a data one. So
 * `carrier` is not a courtesy row on this list: it is the daughter who is
 * carrying the whole thing, named, with what she is carrying said out loud.
 *
 * ─── Derived, recomputed, never stored ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Invariant 6. This is a READING of the household, the way `measureAscension`
 * and `RecordView` are — nothing here is written back. A cast written into the
 * world would be correct for one spring and then quietly wrong for four
 * hundred years, which is exactly what this codebase's worst bugs look like
 * from outside.
