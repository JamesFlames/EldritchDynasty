/**
 * WHAT AN AGENT NEEDS TO KNOW BEFORE IT KNOWS ANYTHING ELSE.
 *
 * Three facts, printed at session start, because all of them are invisible and
 * every one has already cost this repository something.
 *
 * ONE: THE CLONE ARRIVES SHALLOW, AND GIT LIES ABOUT HISTORY WHEN IT IS.
 *
 * A fresh session gets 59 commits of a 141-commit main and `.git/shallow` on
 * disk. `git merge-base --is-ancestor` cannot walk past the graft boundary and
 * does not fail there — it answers FALSE. So `git branch --merged`, `git log
 * main..branch` and every "has this landed?" come back wrong, in the direction
 * that looks cautious, which is why the wrong answer gets believed. A cleanup
 * script trusted it once and reported 29 branches as unmerged that were all
 * merged; the repair took an hour and deleted the same branches twice.
 *
 * Documenting that was not enough — this codebase's own history is a list of
 * rules that were only ever asked for. So the trap is removed instead: the
 * session unshallows, and the question becomes answerable.
 *
 * TWO: WHAT `main` LAST GOT BACK FROM CI. An agent that arrives to a red or
 * unjudged trunk should know before it starts, not after it has rebased onto
 * one. Seven commits landed unjudged over sixteen hours in September 2026 and
 * the only reason anybody found out was somebody reading the Actions list by
 * hand a day later.
 *
 * THREE: SOMEBODY ELSE MAY BE HOLDING THE ISSUE YOU ARE ABOUT TO START.
 * Claims live on refs nobody has to read a document to see (docs/PARALLEL.md).
 * Printing them here is the difference between a protocol and a suggestion.
 *
 * NODE RATHER THAN BASH, WHICH IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PORT. This was the
 * first thing a session ran and it was `#!/usr/bin/env bash`. On a Windows
 * checkout it did not run, and it did not say so: the clone stayed shallow, so
 * every ancestry answer for the rest of that session was wrong in the
 * direction that looks cautious, and the claims other agents held were simply
 * not printed. The failure of an orientation step is invisible BY
 * CONSTRUCTION — there is nothing to compare its silence against.
 *
 * Never fails a session. Every step is forgiving and the exit is always 0: an
 * orientation step that can break a session is worse than no orientation.
