/**
 * THE FOUR THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT ON WINDOWS, IN ONE FILE.
 *
 * AGENTS.md says this repository is supported on Windows and Linux, under
 * Claude Code and Codex, and that all four combinations are first-class. That
 * was prose for months while the session hook, the orientation step, the two
 * edit guards and the janitor were all `#!/usr/bin/env bash` — and two of them
 * shelled out to `jq`, which is not installed on a Windows box, a Linux box or
 * a CI runner unless somebody put it there.
 *
 * A bash script does not fail loudly on Windows. A SessionStart hook that
 * cannot run prints nothing an agent sees, so the clone stays shallow, every
 * ancestry question answers wrongly, and the claims other sessions hold are
 * invisible. That is this codebase's signature failure mode wearing a shell
 * script, and `portability.test.ts` is the gate that keeps it fixed.
 *
 * Everything here is one of four facts:
 *
 *   1. npm is a `.cmd` shim on Windows and cannot be spawned without a shell.
 *   2. A symlink needs a privilege on Windows that a junction does not.
 *   3. Paths arrive with backslashes, a drive letter of either case, and
 *      compare case-insensitively.
 *   4. stdin is how a hook is handed its payload, and `jq` is not available
 *      to read it.

/**
 * NODE 24 DOES NOT SPAWN WINDOWS `.cmd` SHIMS WITHOUT A SHELL.
 *
 * `npm` on Windows is `npm.cmd`, and a `.cmd` is not an executable — it is a
 * script the command processor interprets. Spawning it without `shell: true`
 * fails with ENOENT, and spawning it WITH a shell hands every argument to the
 * command processor to re-split, which breaks the moment one of them contains
 * a space.
 *
 * npm gives every lifecycle script the path to its own JavaScript CLI in
 * `npm_execpath`, so the way through is to run that CLI with the Node binary
 * already running this process. Argument boundaries survive, and there is no
 * shell in the middle.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `land.mjs` because the landing is no longer the
 * only thing that spawns npm: the session hook installs dependencies and warms
 * the content cache, and it was calling a bare `npm` that does not exist under
 * that name on half the platforms this repository claims to support.

/**
 * A REPOSITORY PATH, IN THE ONE SPELLING EVERYTHING ELSE COMPARES AGAINST.
 *
 * The edit guards match on `packages/content/loci.yaml`. What a hook is handed
 * on Windows is `C:\Users\somebody\repos\EldritchDynasty\packages\content\loci.yaml`,
 * and on Linux the same path with the other slash. Three things differ and all
 * three are silent: the separator, the case of the drive letter, and the case
 * of every segment after it.
 *
 * So this is the only place a path is turned into something to compare: POSIX
 * separators, relative to the repository root, and — on Windows only — folded
 * to lower case, because that is the platform where two spellings name one
 * file. Folding case on Linux would let a guard refuse a file it has no
 * business refusing, which is the failure that gets a guard switched off.
 *
 * Returns null when the path is outside the repository, which every caller
 * treats as "not mine to judge".
 *
 * IT RESOLVES WITH THE NAMED PLATFORM'S RULES RATHER THAN THE HOST'S, and
 * that is the difference between a platform branch and a platform branch
 * anybody can check. `path.resolve` on Linux does not know that `C:\repo` is
 * absolute, so it makes one up relative to the cwd and the fold silently
 * returns `c:/repo/packages/...` — a wrong answer, in a function whose entire
 * job is to produce the string two guards compare against, on the platform
 * where no test could reach it. AGENTS.md asks for exactly this: platform-only
 * behaviour must be guarded and covered by a test, and a test on a Linux
 * runner can only cover it if the platform is an argument all the way down.

/**
 * THE PATHS A TOOL CALL TOUCHES, UNDER EITHER AGENT.
 *
 * Both guards used to read `tool_input.file_path` and nothing else. That is
 * the CLAUDE payload. Codex sends a different shape for the same act: the tool
 * is `apply_patch`, and the files it writes are named inside a unified-diff
 * envelope on `tool_input.command`, as `*** Update File: <path>` lines. There
 * is no `file_path` key in it at all.
 *
 * So under Codex the lookup returned nothing, the guard hit its "no path, not
 * mine to judge" line, and every rule it enforces passed silently on the exact
 * edit it exists to refuse. A guard that cannot read the payload is
 * indistinguishable from no guard, and neither one ever prints anything — this
 * repository's signature failure, inside its own enforcement.
 *
 * Returns EVERY path the call touches, repo-relative, because one Codex patch
 * writes several files and the generated one need not be first. A rename is an
 * edit of its destination, so `*** Move to:` counts. Anything unparseable
 * yields nothing, which every caller treats as a call to allow.

 * whose only dependency is missing does not error in a way anybody sees. It
 * prints to a stream nothing reads and the edit goes through.
