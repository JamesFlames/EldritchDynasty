/**
 * WHO IS WORKING ON WHAT, IN A PLACE NO AGENT OWNS.
 *
 * Every agent on this project authenticates to GitHub as JamesFlames. There is
 * one identity between all of them, so `assignees` cannot say which agent holds
 * an issue — every claim reads the same. Labels and comments cannot arbitrate a
 * race either: both are read-then-write over an API with no compare-and-swap,
 * so two agents that look a second apart both see the issue free and both take
 * it. The tracker is where a HUMAN sees what is claimed. It is not the lock.
 *
 * Git ref creation IS a compare-and-swap. Pushing a branch that already exists,
 * carrying a commit that is not a descendant of the one already there, is
 * rejected by the server — always, by protocol, for every ref under
 * refs/heads/. So a claim here is an ORPHAN commit (no parent, empty tree)
 * pushed to `claim/<slug>`. Orphan, so that no second claim can ever be a
 * fast-forward of the first and quietly win. Empty tree, so that taking a claim
 * touches no file, needs no clean working copy, and cannot be merged into
 * anything by accident.
 *
 * The commit message is the payload: which agent, which lane, which paths it
 * means to write. That last field is the useful one — `check` reads every open
 * claim and tells an agent whose declared paths overlap its own BEFORE either
 * has written a line, which is the only cheap moment to find out.
 *
 * A claim is advisory. It stops two agents starting the same issue; it cannot
 * stop one that never ran this. See docs/PARALLEL.md for the lanes and for the
 * part of this repo that is not parallel-safe at all.
 *
 *   npm run agents                       # who holds what, and for how long
 *   npm run agents -- take 93 --paths packages/core/src/economy
 *   npm run agents -- check              # my claim, and anyone overlapping it
 *   npm run agents -- release 93         # tombstones the ref; the issue is free again
 *   npm run agents -- steal 93           # only once a claim has gone stale
