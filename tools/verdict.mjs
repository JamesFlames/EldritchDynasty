/**
 * DID CI ACTUALLY ANSWER? — AND "NO" IS NOT THE SAME AS "RED".
 *
 * `npm run land` ends by pushing to `main`. That is not the end of the work.
 * Between 2026-09-05 09:02 and 2026-09-06 01:12, seven consecutive pushes to
 * `main` produced a workflow run that concluded in three to five seconds with
 * a single job carrying zero steps — a run that never started, because the
 * repository was out of Actions minutes while it was private. Six of those
 * seven commits were agent landings. Nobody noticed for sixteen hours.
 *
 * Nothing in this repository told an agent a push was unfinished until a
 * verdict came back, and in every UI a red run and a run that never happened
 * are the same colour. This codebase's own thesis, turned on its own CI: it
 * failed by doing nothing, and looked exactly like a feature nobody had
 * exercised yet.
 *
 * So there are FOUR states here, not two:
 *
 *   green    every job succeeded                                      exit 0
 *   red      a job failed, and this names which                       exit 1
 *   absent   no verdict for that commit — CI did not run, or ran and  exit 2
 *            recorded nothing. NOT a pass. Usually not the agent's to
 *            fix, and always the agent's to report.
 *   pending  CI is running and has not answered yet                   exit 3
 *
 * THE FOURTH ONE IS HERE BECAUSE THIS TOOL SHIPPED WITHOUT IT AND WAS WRONG.
 * The first landing to use it reported NO VERDICT for a commit whose `check`
 * run was still in progress — "not yet" reported as "never", which is the
 * same two-states-where-there-are-three mistake the whole issue was about,
 * made inside the fix for it. A pending run and a run that never existed had
 * written the same thing to the refs: nothing.
 *
 * `verdict.yml` now records a run when it STARTS as well as when it finishes,
 * so `pending` is a thing the refs can say. Absence stays honest, because a
 * run that never starts never announces itself either.
 *
 * WHY A GIT REF RATHER THAN THE ACTIONS API. Because the API is not reachable
 * from where this has to run. Measured in an agent container, 2026-09-07:
 *
 *   curl https://api.github.com/repos/JamesFlames/EldritchDynasty/actions/runs
 *   → 403 {"message":"GitHub access is not enabled for this session."}
 *
 * The host is allowed; the session holds no credential for it. Only the MCP
 * tools do, and a script cannot call those. `git fetch` works, including over
 * a custom ref namespace. docs/PARALLEL.md makes the same argument about the
 * claim mutex — "a local agent and a web session do not have the same tools,
 * and both have `git push`" — and this is its other half: they do not have the
 * same API access, and both have `git fetch`.
 *
 * `.github/workflows/verdict.yml` writes `refs/verdict/<sha>` when a `check`
 * run completes. This reads it. Nothing here needs a token, and it behaves
 * identically on a laptop, in a container and inside CI.
 *
 *   npm run verdict                  # HEAD, waiting up to 40 minutes
 *   npm run verdict -- <sha>         # a particular commit
 *   npm run verdict -- --wait 0      # ask once and answer now

 * that finished shortly after. A timeout is not an answer, and a tool whose
 * default produces the wrong one is worse than one that takes longer.
