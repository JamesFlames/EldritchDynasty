/**
 * WHAT A TEST FILE COSTS — ALL OF IT, NOT JUST THE PART INSIDE `it()`.
 *
 * ── WHY THE OBVIOUS INSTRUMENT IS THE WRONG ONE ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Vitest's own JSON reporter gives each file the span from its first test
 * STARTING to its last one ENDING. Measured against this repository that is
 * not the cost of the file, and the gap is not small:
 *
 *   the whole suite, by the JSON reporter   28.3 min of test time
 *   the same run, by the clock              ~62 min on four cores
 *
 * Roughly half the work is outside every test body. `arcs.slow.test.ts` is
 * the clearest case: it collects `const BATCH = runBatch(COVERAGE_SEEDS)` at
 * MODULE SCOPE — 360 thousand-year runs, deliberately, so that four
 * assertions share one batch instead of playing it four times. The JSON
 * reporter attributes every second of that to nothing at all and reports the
 * file at 55 seconds.
 *
 * A packing built on those numbers would put the batch files together and be
 * confidently wrong, which is the same shape as the path-hash sharding it
 * replaces — a number that looks like a duration and is a fact about
 * something else. So this reporter records the four spans vitest actually
 * tracks per file and adds them:
 *
 *   prepare      standing the worker up
 *   environment  jsdom, where a suite asks for one
 *   collect      importing the module — where a module-scope batch lives
 *   tests        the test bodies
 *
 * `tools/cost.mjs` attaches this, `tools/shards.mjs` packs from what it
 * writes, and `lanes.test.ts` fails the build when the packing drifts.

  /**
   * IT COUNTS THE TESTS TOO, AND THAT IS NOT A CONVENIENCE.
   *
   * `cost.mjs` used to read "Tests N passed" back out of the DEFAULT
   * reporter's summary with a regular expression. Attaching this reporter
   * beside it took `--outputFile`, the default reporter stopped printing what
   * that regex wanted, and AGENTS.md's `npm test` line silently kept saying
   * "1,961 tests in 132 files, ~30 min" against a measured 2,528 in 157 and
   * about fourteen minutes.
   *
   * Which is this whole epic in miniature: a tool for keeping a number true,
   * quietly failing to write it, with the stale number left in place and
   * nothing saying so. A reporter already holds the tasks — so it counts them
   * here, and nothing has to parse anybody's prose.
