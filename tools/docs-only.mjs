/**
 * A CHANGE THAT TOUCHES ONLY MARKDOWN GETS THE SHORT SET — IF ITS BASE WAS GREEN.
 *
 * A landing that edits one sentence of `ARCHITECTURE.md` used to spend the
 * same forty minutes as one that rewrites the mortality pass, and CI spent the
 * same half hour of runners on it. Most of that is the gates and the slow
 * suites, and NEITHER OF THEM CAN SEE A MARKDOWN FILE: they load the
 * simulation sources and `packages/content`, whose loader refuses anything
 * that is not YAML. A diff made only of `.md` files cannot change one number
 * they compute.
 *
 * WHAT DOES READ MARKDOWN IS THE FAST LANE, and it reads it as data, not as
 * prose. `codemap.test.ts` fails on a dead path, a dead link, a second copy of
 * a timing and an oversized `AGENTS.md`; `codex.test.ts` on the Codex byte
 * budget; `docs.test.ts` on a hand-edited `docs/VOCABULARY.md`; `land.test.ts`
 * and `settings.test.ts` on sentences in `AGENTS.md` they depend on. So "only
 * markdown changed" is NOT "nothing can break" — which is why the short set is
 * exactly CI's short tier (typecheck, validate, the fast lane) and not nothing.
 * `land.test.ts` fails the build if code outside the fast lane starts reading
 * a markdown file, which is the day this reasoning stops being true.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT THE RULE `land.mjs` RETIRED. `docs/PARALLEL.md` once asked the
 * agent to classify its own diff and pick a shorter path for "docs" — a
 * judgement, made from memory, with no definition of docs. This is a function
 * over `git diff` with one definition, and it fails SAFE: any file that is not
 * markdown, a diff it cannot compute, or an empty one is the full set.
 *
 * AND ONLY ON A GREEN BASE. The short set proves "this changed nothing the
 * full set reads" — which is a pass only if the full set passed on the commit
 * underneath. On a red, pending or unjudged `main`, a docs-only commit would
 * otherwise collect a green verdict it did not earn, and every reader of "is
 * trunk green" — the session banner, the scoreboard, the next landing — would
 * be told the red had gone away. That is a lie with the actor unnamed, the one
 * thing this repository refuses in its own simulation, so the base's verdict
 * is read off `refs/verdict/<sha>` and anything short of `success` runs it all.
 *
 * ONE MODULE, TWO CALLERS. `land.mjs` imports `landingPlan`; `check.yml`'s
 * `tier` job runs this file as a command. Two copies of the rule would be two
 * rules within a month.
 *
 *   node tools/docs-only.mjs <base> <head>   # prints `short` or `full`; why, on stderr
