/**
 * THE LANDING, AS ONE COMMAND, RUNNING THE SAME SET CI RUNS.
 *
 * AGENTS.md carries standing authorisation to fast-forward `main` with no pull
 * request "as soon as `npm run check` is green". CI runs THREE jobs. `check` is
 * `typecheck && validate && test` — it does not run the gates.
 *
 * That gap is not theoretical. Four of the eleven red runs of `check.yml` on
 * `main` in runs 61-100 failed at the `gates` step, each one AFTER the whole
 * test suite had been green for forty-one minutes. An agent that ran the check,
 * saw green and pushed did exactly what the rulebook told it to and broke trunk.
 *
 * docs/PARALLEL.md patched over it by asking the agent to classify its own diff
 * first — gates "after the rebase, always" for content, `test:fast` and a gate
 * for docs — which is a decision made before the answer is known, with a
 * shorter path available for getting it wrong.
 *
 * So the landing is one command and the set is derived, not remembered:
 * `land.test.ts` reads `.github/workflows/check.yml` and fails the build if CI
 * grows a job this does not run. That is the same argument check.yml already
 * makes for iterating GATES rather than naming gates in a list — gate 2 was
 * written for CI and wired into nothing for its whole life under a hand-kept
 * list. This is that argument one level up.
 *
 *   npm run land                     # fetch, rebase, install, the whole set,
 *                                    # push, then WAIT for CI
 *   npm run land -- --status         # is a landing running, or did one die?
 *   npm run land -- --dry-run        # print the plan and do none of it
 *   npm run land -- --no-verdict     # push and do not wait to be judged
 *   npm run land -- --no-issue-check # land even though the branch names an
 *                                    # issue no commit closes
 *
 * IN A WEB SESSION, START IT SO THAT IT SURVIVES THE SESSION. A landing runs
 * for about an hour and a remote container is paused between turns; twice on
 * 2026-09-08 a `nohup … &` landing was killed by that pause and left no
 * error, no exit code and a log that simply stopped. Use the harness's own
 * tracked background run instead — see AGENTS.md, "Working style". If you
 * come back and are not sure, `--status` answers it.
 *
 * What this does NOT do is put the gates in the fix-and-rerun loop. `npm run
 * gate` is nine minutes; it belongs here, once, on the rebased head. The loop
 * is still `npm run test:fast`.

 * ── THE TWO STEPS THAT RUN AT THE SAME TIME ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * A landing ran its four steps back to back because that is the order a
 * terminal reads in. Two of them are almost all of it, and they do not
 * compete for the same machine:
 *
 *   npm test    ~40 min, and vitest gives it a worker per core — 4 on the
 *               container this is measured on.
 *   npm run gates  ~36 min, and it is ONE node process running the gate table
 *               in a serial `for` loop. One core, for thirty-six minutes,
 *               while three sat idle behind the test run that just finished.
 *
 * Sequentially that is about 76 minutes of wall clock for about 196 core-
 * minutes of work. Run together on four cores the same work packs into
 * roughly 49. Nothing is skipped and nothing is sampled differently — the
 * gates play the same runs either way, because every stream is derived from
 * `(runSeed, …)` and not from the wall clock or from what else is running.
 *
 * THE CHEAP STEPS STILL GO FIRST, AND STILL GO ONE AT A TIME. `typecheck` and
 * `validate` are about twenty-three seconds together and they are the ones
 * that catch a broken template or a bad schema, so a landing should still
 * fail in seconds rather than after the suite. Only the long pair overlaps.
 *
 * IT ALSO REPORTS BOTH. A serial landing dies at the first failure, so a red
 * test hides a moved gate and costs another 76 minutes to find — which is the
 * argument `check.yml` makes for running its jobs separately, and it was true
 * of the landing the whole time it was written down there. Both run to
 * completion now and a failure names every step that failed.

 * said so — this codebase's house failure mode, applied to its own process.
 * The convention was already written down, correctly, in AGENTS.md and

 * `npm run land` never saw the sentence. Documentation that has to be found
 * is a check that has to be remembered, and this repository does not trust
 * that shape anywhere else.
 *
 * `janitor.sh` already asks this exact question — "#$slug is still OPEN and
 * no landing commit named it" — but only for a CLAIMED issue, and only after
 * the merge. This asks it before the push, off the branch-naming convention
 * every session gets for free (`claude/issue-<N>-...`), whether or not the
 * claim protocol was used.
 *
 * A pure function over two strings, the same shape as `ciScripts`: nothing
 * here calls git, so a test can hand it a commit log it must reject without
 * landing anything. The keyword pattern is copied from `janitor.sh` rather
 * than re-derived, so what this refuses to land and what GitHub would have

 * `claude/three-issues-8e7grn` — so there is no number in it to find, this
 * returned null, and the landing said nothing. The session most likely to
 * forget the convention is the one shape this could not see.
 *
 * The claim refs already know. `agents.mjs` records the branch on every
 * `claim/<issue>` and already prints the exact line a landing commit needs;
