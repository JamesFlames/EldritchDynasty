/**
 * THE TIDYING NO AGENT CAN DO FOR ITSELF.
 *
 * A Claude session's git proxy refuses ref deletion — 403, every time — so no
 * agent has ever deleted its own merged branch or its own spent claim. That one
 * restriction is the entire explanation for the thirty-odd `claude/*` branches
 * on this remote. An Actions runner has no such limit, so the sweep lives here
 * and `.github/workflows/janitor.yml` is four lines that call it.
 *
 * It is a script rather than YAML so that it can be READ and RUN:
 * `DRY_RUN=1 node tools/janitor.mjs` prints every action it would take and
 * performs none of them, against whatever remote you point it at.
 *
 * NODE RATHER THAN BASH, AND THE READING IS THE REASON. The bash version used
 * `declare -A`, process substitution and `[[ =~ ]]` — bash 4 features, none of
 * which Git Bash on Windows can be relied on to have and none of which
 * PowerShell has at all. So the one command in this repository that deletes
 * things could only be dry-run from a Linux box, which is the opposite of the
 * arrangement you want for a command that deletes things. AGENTS.md says
 * Windows and Linux are both first-class; this is the file where that claim
 * was least true and mattered most.
 *
 * WHAT IT KEYS OFF, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE ISSUE NUMBER.
 *
 * A branch lands as many issues as its agent claimed — an epic's three
 * sub-issues, a fix and the test-gate it needed. So the unit of "this work is
 * finished" is the BRANCH being an ancestor of main, and the claims are found
 * from it: each claim records the branch holding it (`agent:`), so one merge
 * retires all of them without anybody enumerating anything.
 *
 * Closing an issue is a different question from releasing a lock, and this
 * script keeps them apart. A claim is retired on merge, always: the branch is
 * gone, so the lock has no owner. An ISSUE is closed only where somebody said
 * so — a closing keyword in a landing commit, which GitHub honours by itself on
 * the default branch. An issue held by a merged branch that nobody named is
 * REPORTED and left open, because a branch that lands part of an epic is the
 * normal case and a script cannot tell it from one that finished.
 *
 *   DRY_RUN=1 node tools/janitor.mjs              # what would happen
 *   JANITOR_RANGE=abc..def node tools/janitor.mjs # also close what those named

 *
 * The first run of this script deleted 29 branches it should have kept. The
 * decision was wrong on the runner and right in two local runs over the same
 * refs, and the reason it could act on that wrongness is that it deleted inside
 * the loop that decided — no pass ever saw the whole answer, so nothing could
 * notice the answer was absurd.
 *
 * THE CEILING IS A COUNT, NOT A SHARE, AND THAT CHANGE IS LOAD-BEARING.
 *
 * Guarding on the share was the natural way to say "this looks like everything
 * at once", and it fired on every run from #21 to #23 and deleted nothing for
 * days. All nine branches it refused were genuinely merged: this repository
 * fast-forwards without pull requests, so every branch that ever lands ends up
 * merged, and "nearly all of them are merged" is the NORMAL steady state
 * rather than an alarm. A share ceiling here refuses hardest exactly when it
 * has the most legitimate work to do, and a guard that always fires is a guard
 * nobody reads.
 *
 * What it was protecting against was a MASS DELETION, and a mass deletion is a
 * number of branches, not a proportion of them. The shallow-clone refusal
 * above is the real defence: it removes the condition that produced the false
 * readings rather than trying to recognise their shape afterwards.
