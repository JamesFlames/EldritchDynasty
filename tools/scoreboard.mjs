/**
 * WHAT THE AGENT LOOP COSTS, MEASURED THE WAY THE GAME IS MEASURED.
 *
 * This repository measures the simulation obsessively. `docs/BALANCE-LOG.md`
 * records what every content drop did to the frequency tiers. Nine gates play
 * thousands of years to ask whether a design claim is true. `npm run digest`
 * proves a refactor changed nothing.
 *
 * None of it is pointed at the loop the agent runs. Every figure in issue #116
 * — 11 red runs in 40, seven landings with no verdict at all, four of the reds
 * at the `gates` step that `npm run check` never ran — was obtained by hand,
 * once, by reading the Actions list. Which means the rest of that epic was
 * unfalsifiable: it would be fixed, and nobody could say by how much.
 *
 * WHY THIS READS REFS AND NOT THE API. Same reason `verdict.mjs` does, and the
 * reason is measured: a session's curl to api.github.com comes back
 * `403 GitHub access is not enabled for this session`. `git fetch` works.
 * `.github/workflows/verdict.yml` records every `check` run onto
 * `refs/verdict/<sha>`, so the history of what CI decided is in the repository
 * rather than behind a credential this tool cannot hold.
 *
 * That has one honest consequence worth stating plainly: it can only see back
 * as far as the verdict refs go, and they were first written on 2026-09-07.
 * The 40-run history in #116 predates them and is not reconstructible here.
 * A scoreboard that quietly reported "0 red in 3 runs" while the epic's own
 * evidence lay outside its window would be worse than none, so it says how
 * many commits it could and could not judge.
 *
 *   npm run scoreboard              # the last 40 commits on main
 *   npm run scoreboard -- 100       # a longer window

/**
 * ── WHAT CI SAID ABOUT THIS COMMIT, AND WHERE IT SAID IT ──────────────────
 *
 * This reported a 4-for-4 green trunk as 84.8% red, and both halves of that
 * were one comparison each.
 *
 * A VERDICT FROM A FEATURE BRANCH IS NOT A VERDICT ABOUT `main`. Commits reach
 * trunk by fast-forward, in batches — four landed within six seconds on
 * 2026-09-19 — so only the tip of a batch ever gets a push run on `main` and
 * the rest keep the verdict from the branch they were written on, including
 * mid-development reds that were fixed before they landed. 28 of the 32 judged
 * commits were that. The ref has always carried `branch:`; nothing read it.
 *
 * AND A CANCELLED RUN IS NOT A FAILED ONE. `cancel-in-progress` kills a run
 * the moment the next push arrives, which is what that setting is for; 24 of
 * those 28 died that way. A run that was stopped before it finished answered
 * no question at all, and the honest thing to do with a non-answer is to give
 * it its own column — the same discipline that made this tool report
 * `unjudged` separately instead of claiming a clean sheet.
 *
 * So the order below is the order of the questions: is there a verdict at
 * all, did it come from trunk, is it still running, was it stopped, did it
 * pass. Only the last two are a colour.
 *
 * Exported so `scoreboard.test.ts` can hand it commits whose verdicts it
 * controls — including a window with no verdicts at all, which must report as
 * unjudged rather than as a clean sheet.
